Full text:   Procter & Gamble Co. is planning to add weeks to the amount of time it takes to pay its suppliers, a shift that could free up as much as $2 billion in cash for the consumer products giant, people familiar with the matter said.
P&G could use that cash to fund investments in new factories overseas or to help pay for stock buybacks. That added flexibility, however, will come at the expense of the companies that supply P&G with materials or services. The suppliers will have to tie up more of their own cash in receivables or eat the interest costs charged by banks to bridge the gap until P&G pays its bills.
The move highlights how America's biggest companies continue to build on the aggressive cash management practices they adopted in the wake of the credit crisis. What began as a way to preserve cash when markets dried up a few years ago has become a means of freeing up money to fund expansions, buy back stock and support dividend payouts at a time of lackluster sales growth and shrinking profit margins.
P&G is actually late to this game. It currently pays its bills on average within 45 days, faster than the 60 to 100 days that other consumer products makers and large companies in other industries generally take, according to industry experts. The company is looking to move its payment terms to 75 days and recently started negotiations with suppliers, people familiar with the matter said.
To help suppliers deal with the changes, P&G is working with banks that will offer to advance cash to suppliers after 15 days for a fee, some of the people said. The changes are expected to be phased in over three years.
Across industries, corporations like DuPont Co. and J.C. Penney Co. are trying to reduce the amount of cash tied up in day-to-day operations by taking more time to pay suppliers, collecting faster from customers or reducing manufacturing and inventory costs.
The moves are creating ripple effects. Companies that hold on to cash longer create deficits at suppliers that have to find financing, raise prices or squeeze other firms along the supply chain. Smaller companies with little bargaining power and less access to credit ultimately could see their costs rise, pinching funds that could otherwise be spent on hiring or investments.
Customers of Eastek International -- a contract manufacturer of electrocardiograms, patient monitors, magnetic door locks and industrial products -- have grown more aggressive about extending payment terms, Chief Executive Joe Rocco said. Eastek now gets paid in an average of 50 days, versus 30 days around six years ago.
"It becomes a cost of doing business for us," said Mr. Rocco, whose company has about 950 employees and operations in Illinois, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and China. The increased working capital demands have made the company more cautious about hiring and investing in new equipment, he said.
On the other side of the working capital equation, DuPont has freed up over $2.6 billion in cash from its day-to-day operations over the past four years and is looking to do more. "You don't want to have excess cash tied up in the company that's not generating any value," said Nick Fanandakis, chief financial officer of the manufacturing and science company.
P&G rivals Kimberly-Clark Corp., Church & Dwight Co., Energizer Holdings Inc., and Newell Rubbermaid Inc. have said they are working on stretching out payment terms with some suppliers and making manufacturing processes leaner to reduce inventory costs. Energizer is targeting roughly $200 million in savings from working capital, while Newell is working toward $100 million. The companies declined to disclose how long they take to pay their bills.
"Companies are looking at doing more self funding, because borrowing is not going to be cheap forever," said John Ahearn, global head of trade at Citigroup Inc.
P&G has a lot of demands on its cash. The company, which has raised its shareholder dividend for 57 consecutive years, is in the midst of a large-scale restructuring aimed at reducing expenses by $10 billion by 2016. Shortly after embarking on the cost-cutting plan last year, P&G said it would suspend share buybacks to conserve cash amid an uncertain outlook and to maintain its high credit rating. After coming under pressure from investors, however, it resumed and ramped up the repurchases, in part by using borrowed funds.
Company executives have said they expect to be able to fund increased capital expenditures as well as expansion in emerging markets while continuing to return the bulk of profits to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. The cost cuts and cash freed up by taking longer to pay suppliers will give P&G more flexibility to manage its finances.
P&G currently spends more than $50 billion a year buying everything from plastics and cardboard to fragrances and chemicals from an army of about 75,000 suppliers and agencies. They include companies like MonoSol LLC, which makes water soluble films for P&G's Tide Pods laundry packets; SGS International Inc., which makes printing plates used for packaging for Swiffer wet mops, Gain detergent and other P&G products; and Albany International Corp., which produces fabrics and materials used to make Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels.
The companies wouldn't comment on the terms of their agreements with P&G, which isn't their only customer.
The risk in pushing out payment terms is that it puts financial strain on companies that supply key inputs and are themselves big employers. Unhappy suppliers could try to respond by taking their business to rivals, reducing the cost of producing their products or raising their prices, increasing costs for buyers.
Federal-Mogul Corp., which supplies replacement brake pads, windshield wipers and other spare parts to wholesale and retail distributors, saw a large cash outflow last year after agreeing to extend payment terms on $285 million in receivables from several large retail customers. Executives told analysts on a conference call in February that they don't intend to continue extending payment terms.
"If we need to lose market share because of our terms, I'm willing to concede business if we cannot continue to operate on the margins or the terms that are reasonable for our organization," Mike Broderick, Federal-Mogul's chief executive, said on the call.
Many large companies "have come to understand what can happen to their supplier base when there is disruption" and are looking at how they can help mitigate the impact on suppliers, said Michael McDonough, global head of supply chain at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
Increasingly, companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Unilever PLC and Kohl's Corp. are working with banks to offer their suppliers cheap financing when payment terms are extended. Such financing, which is optional, can enable suppliers to get paid quickly.
The banks in essence take over the invoices, advance payments to suppliers and collect from buyers when the bills come due. Some suppliers can choose to get paid in as few as five to 10 days, even though their customers are taking as long as 90 days to pay.
Low interest rates make the service more affordable. Banks now charge annual rates as low as 1.3% to buy receivables with creditworthy customers like P&G.
P&G is planning to do the same, according to people familiar with the matter. Suppliers that take up the financing offer would get cash advances in 15 days that build in a low interest rate based on P&G's high investment-grade credit rating, the people said.
P&G is pitching this to suppliers as a "win-win" proposition for both sides, they said. The arrangement would benefit suppliers in the U.S. and other countries whose borrowing costs are higher than P&G's.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Seeking to keep a fragile global recovery on track, the International Monetary Fund called on countries that can afford it -- including the U.S. and Britain -- to slow the pace of their austerity measures.
The fund warned that "overly strong" belt-tightening in the U.S. will slow growth this year. Across-the-board government spending cuts, known as the sequester, were the "wrong way" to shrink the budget deficit, it said in its semiannual report on economic growth.
Those cuts should be replaced by more targeted reductions that would take effect further down the road -- after the economy gains strength, the report said.
The U.K. government, which in 2010 embarked on a closely watched effort to escape its slump through tax increases and spending cuts, also should consider easing up on its austerity drive amid a weak recovery there, the IMF said.
And it warned euro-area policy makers against focusing too much on hitting tough deficit targets, saying they risked further deepening their downturn.
"Fiscal adjustment needs to proceed gradually, building on measures that limit damage to demand in the short term," the IMF said.
The IMF also called on countries like Germany that have traditionally relied on exports for growth to lift spending to stimulate their economies and, the IMF hopes, imports from the country's struggling neighbors.
"There is a need for higher demand" in countries with big trade surpluses, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a speech last week. "For countries in Northern Europe, like Germany, it means doing more to boost investment."
The IMF's message chimes with that of the Obama administration and highlights a continuing gulf between leaders of major economies over how best to recover from the crisis that began five years ago.
Many European governments are cutting government spending, raising taxes and pursuing other measures to shrink budget deficits that ballooned after the financial crisis.
Some, such as Greece and Portugal, have no choice under terms of international bailouts. Others, such as the U.K. and Germany, say they must control spending if they want to keep borrowing costs low, and argue that the approach will lead to stronger growth in the long run.
The Obama administration and the IMF have warned the efforts could be self-defeating by restraining growth, which could widen deficits and make their debts harder to pay.
The outcome matters to the U.S. because its economy is closely linked to Europe's and could be hurt if the euro zone's financial turmoil escalates. The White House is seeking to swap the sequester with more backloaded spending cuts and tax increases at home, while pressing European policy makers to slow the pace of their austerity programs and generate stronger growth.
Germany has so far resisted the pressure. "Nobody in Europe sees this contradiction between fiscal-policy consolidation and growth," the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said this month.
The U.K. government has also vowed to stay the course, saying that conditions for growth can only be restored by repairing the country's finances.
On Tuesday, a U.K. Treasury spokesman pointed out that the IMF forecasts better growth for the U.K. economy this year, at 0.7%, than either France, where the economy is forecast to contract, or Germany, where it is expected to grow just 0.6%.
That debate will continue to play out in Washington this week as finance ministers arrive for the crisis lender's annual meetings, amid renewed worries about growth in several regions.
New figures this week showed that China's economy had slowed unexpectedly in the first three months of 2013, sparking concerns that a recovery that began in the second half of last year could be running out of steam.
U.S. consumers are showing fresh caution by pulling back on spending, new data showed Friday, raising worries that the economy could be headed for yet another spring slowdown.
Meanwhile, growth in the euro area is hovering close to zero and the IMF forecast that the region's economy would shrink again in 2013.
The IMF still believes that the U.S., Japan and Europe need to bring their budget deficits under control over the longer term, saying they aren't sustainable.
But it also says countries such as the U.K, with low borrowing costs, should adjust the timing and pace of their efforts to avoid killing growth.

Full text:   Gold posted its biggest one-day percentage drop in 30 years Monday as new signs of a global economic slowdown emerged and fears diminished that central banks' easy-money policies would stoke inflation.
Gold futures for April delivery fell $140.40, or 9.4%, Monday to a two-year low at $1,360.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. That extended their bear-market descent of more than 20% from their 2011 all-time high. Since Thursday, gold prices have declined by more than $203 an ounce, a record skid since the futures began trading in the U.S. in 1974.
The reversal comes as investors are grappling with signs the global economic expansion that began in 2009 is slowing.
The prices of industrial commodities ranging from copper to crude oil tumbled Monday, following news of softer-than-expected economic growth and industrial output in China. Adding to the gloom, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a report showing manufacturing in the region barely expanding.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average marked its worst one-day point decline since Nov. 7, 2012, dropping 265.86 points, or 1.8%, to 14599.20. Declines in commodity-linked sectors such as mining and energy led the selloff, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. dropping 8.3%.
The market selloff continued in early trading Tuesday in Asia, with Japan down 1.3%, Korea down 0.5% and Australia down 0.8%. Gold also traded lower on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, triggering circuit breakers because of steep price drops.
After 12 consecutive annual price rises, gaining more than 500% over that span, gold is being shunned by investors who saw it as a way to generate big returns without the volatility in the stock, bond and real-estate markets.
"The trade is over," said Jason Tamayo, a 24-year-old U.S. Navy veteran who bought about $50,000 in gold -- around 30 ounces -- in October on the view the metal would continue to march higher amid worries about U.S. debt and the stability of the global economy. Mr. Tamayo said he sold his gold Friday, at a loss of $7,200.
The Japanese yen -- which has lost almost a quarter of its value against the dollar since October, amid expectations the Bank of Japan would buy more assets in a bid to reverse years of falling prices -- rose 1.6% in its sharpest advance since Feb. 25.
The gold rout stemmed partly from worries Cyprus and perhaps other nations may become sellers of the precious metal. Other price drags cited by traders included a sale recommendation on gold last week from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and a growing view that stocks are better investments, due to continuing low inflation.
"Forced selling" by investors holding gold was also among the reasons stock and commodity markets tumbled Monday, said John Brynjolfsson, who runs the $1 billion hedge fund Armored Wolf LLC. Investors who borrowed to buy gold at higher prices could be forced to sell other assets to raise cash to meet margin calls -- demands from brokers that they produce cash to cover the reduced market value of their positions.
Gold exchange-traded funds such as the SPDR Gold Trust and the iShares Gold Trust, which purchase and store gold on behalf of investors, have seen a surge in activity. More than $1 billion alone flowed out of the SPDR fund Friday, the third-highest withdrawal on record, according to research firm IndexUniverse.
Flows out of the fund are likely to have been even higher Monday, traders said, after volume in the SPDR fund surged to an all-time high. Gold-backed ETFs can accelerate price declines in the metal as investors cash out, releasing physical gold into the market.
"I think what's happened is that gold, in the way it's traded, has transitioned," said Edward Lashinski, director of strategy and trading for the futures group at RBC Capital Markets. "It transitioned from a store of value into what now appears to be a bubble based on expectations of central-bank liquidity measures."
Gold's capitulation has been months in the making. The price hit a recent high in October and has been in decline since.
Over the past six years, central banks in the U.S. and Europe have printed extraordinary amounts of their currencies in an effort to resuscitate the world economy. Every new round of "quantitative easing," as it has been dubbed, was accompanied by loud warnings that the inevitable result of this easy money would be a surge of inflation. That in turn, helped fuel a 116% increase since 2007 in the price of gold, the classic hedge against inflation, because its value tends to increase as the dollar weakens. Gold stood out against sharp drops over that period in U.S. stocks and houses.
But the inflation hasn't arrived, despite all the money-printing by central banks. Consumer prices in the major developed economies are increasing at a less-than-2% annual pace; in the rest of the world, that is around 6%.
The collapse of gold is provoking a chorus of "I told you so" from those long skeptical that the rise in the metal's price was a harbinger of inflation. The recent drop in gold coincides with weakness in other commodities. That is seen by some as a signal the world economy -- and China's, in particular -- may be slowing. Prices of commodities are exquisitely sensitive to changes in demand, and thus are an important gauge of the global pace of industrial activity.

Hardware Chain Hires
Restructuring Lawyers
Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp., a hardware and garden chain spun off from Sears Holdings Corp. in 2012, has hired restructuring lawyers as it faces a coming debt payment and pursues talks with lenders.
In recent weeks, publicly traded Orchard Supply, which carries about $230 million in debt, has hired restructuring lawyers at DLA Piper. Financial adviser FTI Consulting is also working with the company.
Meanwhile, some lenders involved in restructuring talks have enlisted turnaround firm Zolfo Cooper LLC and lawyers at Dechert LLP, people familiar with the matter said.
Orchard Supply, which employs about 5,400 people on the West Coast, and its lenders are discussing an out-of-court restructuring or a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy filing, these people said.
A spokeswoman for the San Jose, Calif.-based company said it was in "productive talks" with lenders to restructure its balance sheet.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AT&T, Verizon Control
Of Airwaves Challenged
AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. shouldn't be allowed to box out smaller wireless carriers from picking up some of the nation's prime airwaves, the Justice Department told federal regulators Friday.
As Americans become increasingly dependent on smartphones and the mobile Internet, the Federal Communications Commission is planning to auction some of the airspace used by broadcast television to wireless companies. Those particular airwaves are in the lower frequency range and are ideal for transmitting data over long distances in rural areas or through walls.
A key issue now is which companies will be permitted to buy such valuable property.
AT&T and Verizon currently own much of the beachfront airspace. The two smaller national wireless carriers, Sprint Nextel Corp. and T-Mobile USA, argue they should get a leg up in acquiring these airwaves or larger companies should at least be required to sell some of their holdings.
The Justice Department appeared to side with the smaller carriers Friday in its filing with the FCC. It suggested the FCC should craft rules so that Sprint and T-Mobile have an advantage in picking up the new airwaves.

FORTESCUE METALS
Mining Company Plans
More Trading With Yuan
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. plans to increase its use of the yuan for buying and selling products after Australia and China reached a deal last week that allows the nations' currencies to be converted directly.
Andrew Forrest, chairman of the world's fourth-largest iron-ore producer, said the company already uses the yuan in a "small percentage" of its trades. But he urged China to do more to remove obstacles to trading directly in yuan, also known as the renminbi or RMB.
China is Australia's biggest trading partner and the world's largest buyer of commodities, including copper and iron ore.
"We don't have a specific goal," Mr. Forrest said on Friday. "But I'd like a considerable percentage of our turnover to start being reflected in RMB and really encourage that market."

CBS
Network CEO Moonves
Saw Pay Decline in 2012
CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves earned total compensation valued at $62.2 million in 2012, an 11% drop from the previous year, according to a company regulatory filing on Friday.
The television broadcaster's annual "proxy" filing said Mr. Moonves was paid a salary of $3.5 million and a $27.5 million bonus, plus other compensation including stock and option awards. The drop in compensation came largely from lower option awards.
Mr. Moonves is among the highest paid executives in the entertainment industry. Over the past few years, he has guided the CBS broadcast network to the highest ratings in the industry.
In a statement, CBS pointed to the company's 40% stock rise in 2012 and said the company has been at the forefront of monetizing its content "in a host of new, incremental ways."

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- Nissan Motor Co. is considering a new plant in North America to produce at least 100,000 of its premium Infiniti vehicles a year, likely starting in 2017 as the auto maker fans out production globally from Japan.
"One of the challenges we face is that we really do not have a diversified geographical footprint for manufacturing," Infiniti Motor Co. President Johan de Nysschen said Sunday.
Apart from producing one model in the U.S. for global consumption, the Infiniti brand's current production was "totally concentrated" in Japan, he said.
But that is changing. In May 2012 the company announced plans to produce two Infiniti models for the Chinese domestic market in Xiangyang, Hubei province, with Nissan's local partner, Dongfeng Motor Co.
Mr. de Nysschen said more details will be announced around the Shanghai auto show, which officially starts April 21.
Premium compact models for the global market will be produced at Nissan's Sunderland plant in the U.K. starting in 2015.
Nissan has been the most aggressive of Japan's Big Three auto makers to shift production outside of the country during recent years. That stems from an effort to lower exposure to the yen, make more cars in the markets where Nissan sells them, and adjust to the rapidly shrinking Japanese vehicle market.
The yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar recently, after strengthening to a record level in October 2011. A strong yen hurts the price competitiveness of Japanese exports and reduces the value of profits earned abroad when they are returned home.
For the North American plant, Mr. de Nysschen said options in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are being considered. "No decision has been made yet," he said. "It would be premature for me to hint at locations."
Mr. de Nysschen said existing operations linked to Nissan -- including at Smyrna, Tenn., and in Mexico -- would provide "an easier avenue" to expand North American production because resources, including core vehicle parts, could be shared by the company's brands. But "the question is how much capacity you could build," he said.
Canada, he said, is a "compelling alternative" because it is on the doorstep of the U.S., a significant market for autos. "Canada also has the potential now with free-trade agreements and discussions to be a very viable source of production exports to Europe," he said.
Yet a Nissan representative in Yokohama, Japan, where the company is based, cautioned that a Canadian location might not be considered. "I have no expectations that we plan to produce or assemble in Canada at this time," the representative said.
Trade talks between Canada and the European Union have been under way for almost four years. Dutch Trade Minister Lilianne Ploumen said last week that the EU expects to complete the deal this summer.
Mr. de Nysschen expects Infiniti's new North American plant to begin production in 2017 and have capacity of at least 100,000 vehicles annually, providing roughly 2,000 jobs. A new site could require about $2 billion in investment, while adding to an existing facility could cost around half as much. Infiniti has approximately 65 retail outlets in China and aims to increase that number to more than 80 in time for the start of local production next year.
In contrast, adding Infiniti capacity to a Nissan plant in China would require investment of two billion yuan ($323 million). Production capacity at the plant, which makes the Teana sedan and Murano crossover vehicle, would be increased to 250,000 units from 130,000, Nissan said last year.
For the 12 months ended March 31, Infiniti sold about 172,000 vehicles world-wide. It sold 119,877 vehicles in the U.S. in 2012, up 22% year-to-year.

Full text:   Even before his most ambitious gun-control proposals were falling by the wayside, President Obama was turning for help to the United Nations. On April 2, the United States led 154 nations to approve the Arms Trade Treaty in the U.N. General Assembly. While much of the treaty governs the international sale of conventional weapons, its regulation of small arms would provide American gun-control advocates with a new tool for restricting rights. Yet because the Constitution requires that two-thirds of the Senate give its advice and consent to any treaty, Second Amendment supporters still have a political route to stop the administration.
Like many international schemes, this treaty has seemingly benign motives. It seeks to "eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and to prevent their diversion to the illicit market," where they are used in civil wars and human-rights disasters. The treaty calls for rigorous export controls on heavy conventional weapons, such as tanks, missiles, artillery, helicopters and warships.
Yet, as with many utopian devices, the treaty fails the test of enforcement. Some of the world's largest arms traffickers either voted against the agreement or abstained. The U.S., quite rightly, already has the world's most serious export controls in place, while nations such as North Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and China will continue to traffic in arms with abandon.
But the new treaty also demands domestic regulation of "small arms and light weapons." The treaty's Article 5 requires nations to "establish and maintain a national control system," including a "national control list." Article 10 requires signatories "to regulate brokering" of conventional arms. The treaty offers no guarantee for individual rights, but instead only declares it is "mindful" of the "legitimate trade and lawful ownership" of arms for"recreational, cultural, historical, and sporting activities." Not a word about the right to possess guns for a broader individual right of self-defense.
Gun-control advocates will use these provisions to argue that the U.S. must enact measures such as a national gun registry, licenses for guns and ammunition sales, universal background checks, and even a ban of certain weapons. The treaty thus provides the Obama administration with an end-run around Congress to reach these gun-control holy grails. As the Supreme Court's Heller and McDonald cases recently declared, the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right "to keep and bear Arms" such as handguns and rifles. Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce remains broad, but the court's decisions in other cases -- even last year's challenge to the Affordable Care Act -- remind us that those powers are limited.
International treaties don't suffer these limits. The Constitution establishes treaties in Article II (which sets out the president's executive powers), rather than in Article I (which defines the legislature's authority) -- so treaties therefore aren't textually subject to the limits on Congress's power. Treaties still receive the force of law under the Supremacy Clause, which declares that "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land."
Some have argued over the years that this difference in language between laws and treaties allows the latter to sweep more broadly than the former. In Missouri v. Holland (1920), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes followed this logic to declare that no "invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment" applies to the Treaty Power. Congress could win greater favor from the courts for gun-control measures, or President Obama could issue executive orders for a gun registry and background checks, on the claim that he is implementing the treaty.
Missouri read the treaty power broadly under the Supremacy Clause at a time when the courts gave Congress's powers short shrift, but the decision was fundamentally mistaken. The Supremacy Clause referred to treaties "made under the Authority of the United States" not to expand their scope -- but to grandfather in existing agreements such as the Peace Treaty with Great Britain. In Reid v. Covert (1957), a plurality of justices agreed that the treaty power could not undermine the Bill of Rights, rightly trying to close the huge loophole that Missouri had erroneously opened.
The attempt to advance gun control through the Arms Trade Treaty might surprise average Americans, but not liberals, who have been long frustrated by the Constitution's limits on government. Gun-control statutes, like any others, have to survive both the House and the Senate, then win presidential approval. It is far easier to advance an agenda through treaties, unwritten international law and even "norms" delivered by an amorphous "international community."
Opponents of capital punishment have used treaties to press the Supreme Court to stop the death penalty in Texas. Women's rights groups advocate an international convention that would achieve the goals of the failed Equal Rights Amendment. And supporters of bans on "hate speech" invoke international norms to defeat First Amendment objections. There also is an international legal doctrine that during the period when a country has signed but not yet ratified a treaty, it must take no measures that defeat the treaty's object and purposes. Under some liberal theories, this would allow the president to put some measures of the new arms treaty into effect by executive order.
Fortunately the Framers required that the president submit all significant international agreements to the Senate, which must consent to the treaty with the same supermajority needed to send a constitutional amendment to the states or to override an executive veto.
The Senate should block this latest effort to evade the Constitution's controls on federal power. There could be no greater justification for senators to exercise their veto over treaties than the cause of protecting the individual liberties of Americans -- including the right to bear arms.

Full text:   The Obama administration is touting the year-old free-trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea as proof that such pacts boost exports, hoping that will help woo support for an ambitious second-term trade agenda.
The message is clouded, however, by mixed trade data and complaints from some U.S. industries about the effects so far.
Trade in both directions of the goods most affected by the deal has increased. U.S. exports to South Korea of such items -- including aircraft, autos, wines, soybeans and orange juice -- rose 4.1% in the first 12 months after the deal took effect on March 15, 2012, according to customs data from the South Korean Embassy in Washington. South Korea's exports of covered goods climbed 10.4%.
However, total trade between the two countries fell 3.2% during the year after the agreement took effect, according to the embassy figures. And the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea widened. U.S. officials attribute these moves to broader forces, such as slow economic growth in South Korea and the U.S. drought, which depressed certain crop exports.
White House officials say the early returns show such pacts can help the U.S. economy without hurting industries vulnerable to foreign competition, such as autos.
The Obama administration is working toward a free-trade agreement among 11 nations touching the Pacific Ocean, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and on Friday said it would support Japan's bid to become the 12th country in the talks.
"Alongside the U.S.-Korea free-trade agreement and U.S. participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and the East Asia Summit, [the Trans-Pacific Partnership] will serve as a powerful statement of American engagement and staying power in East Asia," Mr. Obama's national-security adviser, Tom Donilon, wrote in an op-ed on WSJ.com.
The administration also is preparing to start negotiations with the European Union on a trans-Atlantic trade pact. President Barack Obama has made export growth a major plank in his administration's effort to rev up U.S. economic growth.
"We did it in South Korea, so we have a track record of success," Demetrios Marantis, the acting U.S. trade representative, said in a recent interview.
South Korea hails the results so far as well. "This clearly looks win-win to both of us," Gheewhan Kim, minister for economic affairs at the South Korean Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a recent speech in Washington.
South Korea is the U.S.'s seventh-biggest trade partner by volume of goods and services exchanged -- with the two-way trade totaling $101.1 billion in 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Obama administration officials sold the South Korea deal as a way to boost U.S. exports to the country by $11 billion annually and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, once fully implemented. Trade experts say it is too soon to assess the impact of an agreement that will eliminate most tariffs between the countries in phases over many years.
U.S. auto makers and steelworkers grumble about the deal.
The auto makers feared the pact would enable their South Korean rivals to continue gaining share of the much larger U.S. auto market.
To address such concerns, the pact immediately lowered tariffs for U.S. cars and light trucks exported to South Korea while leaving in place until 2016 the U.S. tariffs on South Korean cars imported into the U.S. U.S. auto exports to South Korea rose nearly 51% in 2012, to 22,600 vehicles, Commerce Department data show. But that remained far below South Korea's exports to the U.S. of 704,700 vehicles.
Matt Blunt, head of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies on trade matters for General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC, said, "There's obviously a marginal benefit" to U.S. auto makers from the pact, but "I think in a lot of ways the jury's still out as to whether or not it's truly effective in creating a more natural trade relationship."
Mr. Blunt complained that U.S. auto sales in South Korea could be hurt by regulations Seoul has proposed since the deal was put in place. He cited several examples, such as recent moves to eventually penalize cars with carbon emissions above a certain level, and to require the stamping of vehicle identification numbers on a place different from where U.S. law requires.
Mr. Marantis said he has raised concerns with South Korea about its treatment of U.S. auto makers and many issues have been resolved through talks. "We still have work to do with Korea," he said.
Trade officials in Seoul declined to comment.
The United Steelworkers points to the growth of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea over the past year as evidence the agreement is hurting American companies and workers. "A year later, we see the imbalance," said Linda Landros, legislative counsel for the union.
Hankook Tire, a South Korean tire company, said it expects to benefit over time as the pact takes effect. "We are better positioned to win orders at competitive prices compared to our rivals in Japan, China and Europe that have yet to sign a trade pact with the U.S." said Senior Vice President Pae Ho-youl.

Full text:   The Obama administration used new and pointed language to warn Japan not to hold down the value of its currency to gain a competitive advantage in world markets, as the new government in Tokyo pursues aggressive policies aimed at recharging growth.
In its semiannual report on global exchange rates, the U.S. Treasury on Friday also criticized China for resuming "large-scale" market interventions to hold down the value of its currency, calling it a troubling development. The U.S. stopped short of naming China a currency manipulator, avoiding a designation that could disrupt relations between the world powers.
The Chinese Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A Japanese government official reached early Saturday in Tokyo declined to comment directly on the Treasury report, but said, "We will continue to abide by" recent commitments by global financial policy makers to avoid intentional currency devaluation -- "as we have done until now."
The Treasury report appears to be part of a broader strategy by the Obama administration in response to a sharp shift in economic policy in Japan under new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Hours before the currency warning, the White House said it had accepted Mr. Abe's request to join negotiations to create an ambitious pan-Pacific free trade zone, despite objections from the American auto industry and other domestic sectors worried about new competition from Japan. The U.S. government is welcoming economic reforms in Japan while trying to discourage Tokyo from reverting to prior tactics of trade manipulation.
The Bank of Japan kicked off the latest drop in the yen by shocking markets last week by announcing plans for a massive increase in money supply, pledging a sharp increase in purchases of government bonds and other assets. The dollar has risen nearly 7% against the yen since then, and is up 15% since Mr. Abe came into power on Dec. 26.
Policy makers in Japan sensitive to currency complaints and warnings have repeatedly insisted in recent days that the yen's sharp fall has merely been a byproduct of its stimulus policies, not a goal.
"We have no intention to conduct monetary policy targeting the exchange rate," Haruhiko Kuroda, the new Bank of Japan governor whose policies have helped push down the yen, said in a Tokyo speech Friday. The BOJ's policies, he added, were aimed at pulling Japan out of its long slump and that "achieving this goal will eventually provide the global economy with favorable effects."
Amid sluggish global growth, governments face the temptation to lower the value of their currencies to juice exports. Those pressures are aggravated as central banks in the U.S., Europe and Japan seek to spur their economies by pushing cash into the system -- policies that have the effect of weakening their currencies. Seeking higher returns, investors are putting their money into emerging markets, putting upward pressure on those countries' currencies and making their exports more expensive abroad.
The U.S. said it would "closely monitor" Japan's economic policies to ensure they are aimed at boosting growth, not weakening the value of the currency. The yen is now hovering near a four-year low against the dollar, in response to Mr. Abe's policies.
"We will continue to press Japan . . . to refrain from competitive devaluation and targeting its exchange rate for competitive purposes," the Treasury report said.
The yen strengthened following the report, pulling the dollar to as low as 98.08 yen, its lowest level this week. The yen later gave back some gains, as investors came to see the comments less as criticism than as a statement of fact.
American officials have been walking a tightrope in recent months. While worried about a deliberate currency devaluation, they have also tried to encourage Japan's attempts to jump-start growth, after years of frustration in Washington that Tokyo wasn't doing enough to fix its economy.
"The wording does make it clear that the U.S. Treasury is watching extremely closely" to ensure that Japan lives up to promises not to purposely weaken its currency, said Alan Ruskin, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York. But, he added, "the report does not infer that Japan is breaking any agreement."
The Treasury report highlighted the need for more exchange-rate flexibility in many Asian countries, most notably China.
The Treasury used tougher-than-usual language on China, saying Beijing's "recent resumption of intervention on a large scale is troubling." While it noted that China had allowed the yuan to appreciate by about 10% against the dollar since June 2010 -- or 16% including inflation -- the report said the Chinese currency remained significantly undervalued and "further appreciation" was warranted.
The Treasury in recent years has declined to formally label China as a currency manipulator, with officials suggesting that would hurt efforts to encourage Beijing to let the yuan rise.
Still, the question of China's currency has become shorthand in Washington for the broader debate over the economic relationship between the two countries. It was a frequent topic on the campaign trail for both President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney last year, as Mr. Romney pledged that if elected, he would label China a currency manipulator.
On Friday, some U.S. manufacturers criticized the Obama administration for its reluctance to call China a currency manipulator. "The Treasury Department's latest refusal to label China a currency manipulator once again demonstrates President Obama's deep-seated indifference to a major, ongoing threat to American manufacturing's competitiveness, and to the U.S. economy's return to genuine health," said the U.S. Business and Industry Council, an industry lobby group.
The Treasury report also took South Korea to task for seeking to keep a lid on the won as foreign investors flood the economy with cash. "Korean authorities should limit foreign-exchange intervention to the exceptional circumstances of disorderly market conditions," and capital controls should only be used to prevent financial instability, not reduce upward pressure on the exchange rate, Treasury said.

Abstract: After Beijing's air-pollution readings soared in January, local executives for German auto maker BMW AG received bad news: several candidates for midlevel expatriate jobs withdrew their applications. A recent analysis led by the Boston-based Health Effects Institute estimated outdoor particulate matter in China was responsible for roughly 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010, ranking it just behind tobacco smoking.

Full text:   BEIJING -- After Beijing's air-pollution readings soared in January, local executives for German auto maker BMW AG received bad news: several candidates for midlevel expatriate jobs withdrew their applications.
"They called and said they no longer had the support of their families," said Kirk Cordill, managing director and CEO of BMW Group Financial Services China.
BMW isn't alone. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China says air pollution is a key challenge facing companies here, and is an underlying reason why many expatriate workers choose to leave. Soaring levels of pollution are driving expatriates out of Chinese cities, and dissuading others from coming. That is a problem for many multinationals who need to attract some of their brightest and most experienced executives to China at a time when the Chinese market is becoming central to their global success. Volkswagen AG, for instance, is managed in China by Jochem Heizmann, a member of VW's global management board.
Over the years, Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai have become magnets for global entrepreneurs and adventurous young M.B.A. graduates seeking opportunities in China's booming economy. Among them was Marc van der Chijs, who arrived 13 years ago and co-founded leading Chinese online video site Tudou. In March, he packed up and left Shanghai, and headed for Vancouver.
"I was looking for a place where my kids can grow up in a healthy environment," he said.
In January, levels of fine particulate matter measured by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing reached a level 35 times the World Health Organization's recommended standard. Off-the-charts pollution has added to other drawbacks of life in Chinese cities for expatriates: Internet censorship that slows online speeds and blocks access to sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google Drive; and concerns over food safety and water quality.
Incidents such as the recent discovery of more than 6,000 dead pigs in Shanghai's Huangpu River, which supplies much of the city's tap water, make China a particularly hard sell, said Doreen Jaeger-Soong, managing director of legal recruitment firm Hughes-Castell. Among the top concerns for people considering relocation to China is food safety, said Ms. Jaeger-Soong, adding, "Anyone coming from the West is concerned about food and quality of life."
The impact of high air-pollution levels on long-term health weighs on Chinese and foreigners alike. A recent analysis led by the Boston-based Health Effects Institute estimated outdoor particulate matter in China was responsible for roughly 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010, ranking it just behind tobacco smoking.
Even in Hong Kong, which is considered to be far cleaner than Beijing, pollution blowing in from China's mainland has caused some to flee. Petteri Piirinen, the head of Asia sales at Finland-based technology company Okmetic, moved his family of four from Hong Kong when his toddler developed asthma after living there for a year. "Most babies can play for hours without getting tired, but our son was easily fatigued, struggling to breathe," Mr. Piirinen said, noting that his son's condition has improved since they've moved back to Finland.
Headhunters say that requests for corporate departures to lesser-polluted cities outside China have snowballed in recent months. Recruiting has become an uphill challenge, said Carl Hopkins, Asia managing partner of legal recruitment firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, noting that pollution is compounding a long-existing obstacle of high taxation rates.
"The mere decibel level of response when you ask people if they will live here [in China] is telling," said Mr. Hopkins, who is based in Hong Kong. "They all say 'you have to be joking.'"
To be sure, the number of expatriates fleeing pollution hasn't reached the point where it is threatening the operations of global companies. But it is a worrying trend. China relies on foreign investment for technology, management know-how and jobs. Roughly $112 billion in foreign-direct investment flowed into China in 2012, down 3.7% from a year earlier.
International schools are racing to buy sealed domes that cover playgrounds, enabling children to play on days when it is unsafe to run outside, said Mary Ren, product director at the Beijing division of Yeadon, which makes bubblelike domes that purify and pressurize air. Yeadon installed a $650,000, 18,000-square-foot dome at international school Dulwich College Beijing in 2011, Ms. Ren said.
Dulwich sends children into the dome, equipped with basketball courts and special lighting, when the air quality index hits 250, said Cynthia Maclean, head of external relations at Dulwich. By comparison, New York's air quality index was 30 on Friday morning.
Pollution has also spurred concern among China's domestic workers. Some local executives are looking to relocate to cleaner cities said Louisa Wong, founder of Asia-focused executive search firm Bo Le Associates, noting that people think the grass is greener elsewhere. Those in Beijing want to go to Shanghai, those in Shanghai want to go to Hong Kong, and in Hong Kong they want out, Ms. Wong said.
Headhunters say many foreign executives are still keen to move to the mainland to tap opportunities unavailable in the U.S. or Europe. There are around 600,000 foreigners across China according to China's 2010 census. Long-term expatriates in Beijing and Shanghai say life in China in most ways got progressively easier in recent years, with top-notch international schools, specialty import grocery stores and American-themed suburban subdivisions.
"Many people are aware that this is where the growth is, so some are willing to make the trade-off," said Mr. Cordill of BMW. He said BMW is boosting recruitment of Chinese nationals who have been educated abroad and may be willing to return home for opportunities or even family. The world's No. 1 luxury-car manufacturer by sales has also purchased air purifiers for its offices and is helping employees get discounts on purifiers for their homes.
Louie Cheng, president of PureLiving China, which advises clients on cleaning up indoor environments, said the company has done more projects at schools in the past three months than it had in the previous three years combined. Mr. Cheng said properly outfitting an office space in a modern office tower in China with air purifiers can top $100,000.

Abstract: Senior South Korean officials, who met with Secretary of State John Kerry in Seoul on Friday, said their government also was willing to resume humanitarian assistance to the North following weeks of escalating threats by North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun to attack American and allied targets in North Asia and the Pacific. Last year, Mr. Kim scrapped an agreement with Washington that allowed for the provision of food assistance by launching a long-range rocket in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Full text:   SEOUL -- The U.S. and South Korea offered to return to negotiations with North Korea in a bid to reduce tensions that American officials said run the risk of a direct military conflict.
Senior South Korean officials, who met with Secretary of State John Kerry in Seoul on Friday, said their government also was willing to resume humanitarian assistance to the North following weeks of escalating threats by North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun to attack American and allied targets in North Asia and the Pacific.
South Korean officials said the aid shipments could form a pillar of recently elected President Park Geun-hye's "trust" policy toward Pyongyang. Ms. Park seeks to reverse some of the hard-line tactics pursued by her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak.
However, Mr. Kerry during his visit also delivered a renewed warning, saying North Korea would be making a "huge mistake" by conducting new weapons tests, as it appears prepared to do. "We're going to continue to stand our ground," he told a business group in a speech in Seoul Friday, saying the U.S. doesn't bluff on security matters.
Nonetheless, the aim of Mr. Kerry's trip to South Korea was to reduce tensions, and South Korea indicated it was willing to try. "The window for dialogue is always open," South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said Friday following his meeting with Mr. Kerry. "We are always ready to provide humanitarian aid, in principle."
Mr. Kerry was visiting South Korea as part of a three-nation North Asia tour focused on defusing a standoff with North Korea. Pyongyang didn't respond Friday to the overture for talks.
The recent crisis began with Pyongyang's testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles starting late last year. The Obama administration responded by initiating new economic sanctions against North Korea and overseeing stepped-up military exercises with South Korea beginning last month.
U.S. and South Korean officials are concerned Mr. Kim is preparing to launch a midrange Musudan missile while Mr. Kerry is in the region. The top American diplomat visits China on Saturday and Japan on Sunday.
The Obama administration has been divided over the utility of diplomacy with North Korea since taking office in 2009.
President Barack Obama has pledged to engage with some of Washington's staunchest enemies, including Iran, in a bid promote stability and contain the spread of nuclear weapons. But the White House believes it has been rebuffed in its earlier diplomatic overtures toward the North.
Just weeks after Mr. Obama took office, North Korea conducted its second nuclear weapons test. Last year, Mr. Kim scrapped an agreement with Washington that allowed for the provision of food assistance by launching a long-range rocket in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Mr. Kerry said in Seoul that the U.S. wouldn't attempt to block any efforts by Ms. Park to resume a dialogue with Mr. Kim. And the U.S. secretary of state said Washington would consider resuming its own diplomatic channel should Pyongyang display a willingness to begin dismantling its nuclear-weapons program.
Mr. Kerry noted that Mr. Obama recently called off some additional U.S.-South Korean military exercises in an effort to lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.
"We would never stand in the way . . . of a sovereign country to decide to talk bilaterally," Mr. Kerry said. "We also said that we'd engage in bilateral talks in the right circumstances."
The former U.S. senator, however, expressed skepticism that the North could be trusted in negotiations. He said the U.S. was unlikely to resume its own humanitarian assistance to the North because of Kim Jong Eun's backing out of last year's aid agreement.
"We've been down that path before, and we've disappointed by the breach of those agreements," Mr. Kerry said.
Mr. Kerry and Mr. Yun also discussed the potentially thorny issue of a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement that Washington and Seoul are seeking to conclude before Ms. Park visits the White House last week.
The agreement allows for the U.S. to share American-origin nuclear fuel and technology with South Korea.
But Seoul's negotiators are seeking to gain U.S. approval to allow South Korea to begin producing its own nuclear fuel, through both the enrichment of uranium and the reprocessing of spent reactor fuel. U.S. officials are wary of agreeing to such terms, as such technologies could also give Seoul the ability to develop weapons-grade nuclear fuel.
Both diplomats said they were optimistic that a compromise agreement could be reached. But neither official would outline the likely terms for the deal.
Mr. Kerry will travel to Beijing on Saturday. He said he would press Chinese officials to more aggressively seek to stop Kim Jong Eun from threatening the South and advancing North Korea's nuclear program.
Beijing is by far North Korea's largest trade partner and its only remaining strategic ally in Asia. "China has an enormous ability to make a difference here," Mr. Kerry said.

Full text:   Two major commodities-trading firms have amassed much of the world's copper supplies in their warehouses, partly by paying to divert shipments away from other storage hubs, traders and analysts say.
This concentration of copper supplies has sparked concerns among industrial consumers of the metal. Some manufacturers and builders say they are worried that those stockpiles of copper -- which is used in goods including automobiles, circuit boards and plumbing fixtures -- could prove tough to procure if demand were to pick up sharply or output from mines were disrupted.
The London Metal Exchange, the world's main venue for trading of industrial metals, certifies a global network of warehouses that store metal that can be delivered against the exchange's futures contracts. The wait time to receive aluminum and zinc at warehouses at some locations has surged in recent years as those metals have piled up.
Now, there are worries that the trend is spilling over into the copper market.
"The current situation, where LME warehouse owners are paying huge incentives to attract copper, and then have those units subject to long load-out queues, is effectively making that copper unavailable for immediate delivery to serve industrial consumers," a spokesman for Southwire Co., the largest U.S. copper-wire maker, said in an emailed statement.
Copper prices have fallen since February amid expectations of a supply glut, but buyers say they are starting to pay hefty fees to get metal when they need it -- on top of the actual price of copper -- because so much is being diverted into warehouses. The fees have blunted some of the benefit industrial consumers have seen from falling copper costs.
The amount of copper in LME warehouses has surged 84% since the start of the year to 590,175 metric tons, a 10-year high. The increase, more than 270,000 tons, is almost double expectations for the 153,000-ton surplus of copper that experts predict will emerge this year, evidence of warehousers' success in attracting metal from the open market into their facilities.
Much of the excess supplies are stacking up in warehouses owned by Glencore International PLC and Trafigura Beheer BV, according to traders in London, New York and Singapore who trade with the companies or their customers.
Glencore declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Trafigura declined to comment on the company's role in the warehousing system but said most of this year's increase in copper stockpiles is due to slowing demand from China and rising mine production.
The physical trading of raw materials is generally unregulated, and there is nothing illegal about stockpiling metals.
Benchmark copper prices on the LME rose 0.5% Thursday to $7,609 a metric ton.
Traders and analysts say they noticed the shift when copper began piling up in unusual places. The increase is coming at ports that historically haven't been a destination for the metal. Sixty percent of the rise in stockpiles this year has occurred at Antwerp, Belgium, and Johor, Malaysia, according to LME data. Warehouses there, many of which are owned and operated by the two trading firms, held little copper until this year.
Trafigura is the largest warehouse owner in Antwerp, while Glencore owns the most facilities in Johor, and in New Orleans, which has also seen a sharp increase in copper stockpiles, according to LME data.
The LME doesn't make public the amount of metal held in individual warehouses, but traders and analysts say the accumulation is occurring in warehouses owned by Trafigura and Glencore. The companies don't always buy the copper outright but do charge for its storage and assess fees for its movement.
Because of the logistics of moving the metal, the wait for copper out of Antwerp is as long as 25 weeks. In New Orleans, it is 18 weeks, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of LME data. Johor's wait is six weeks.
Fees to get copper delivered in the U.S. are at $132 a ton, a six-month high, according to pricing-information service Platts. The fees in Europe are the highest in four months -- at $85 a ton. The fee is paid by anyone who wants copper available for immediate delivery on the so-called spot market.
Glencore's warehousing arm, Pacorini Metals Group, for months has been trying to attract even more copper to its Johor facilities, according to traders. Earlier this year, Pacorini started to offer suppliers, including South American miners, as much as $120 a ton above the LME's benchmark copper price to direct shipments to its warehouses there, according to London-based traders. That is at least $20 a ton more than metal distributors in China have paid recently, and more than $100 above the prevailing rate elsewhere in Asia, according to traders in New York and London.
Warehouses offering cash payments for metal isn't unprecedented, traders and analysts say, but outbidding other buyers by such a wide margin is rare.
"It is already affecting the market," said Liu Jiang, a purchasing manager at a copper cable maker, adding that spot premiums for copper in Shanghai have climbed by about 40% in the past two weeks. "The lockup in those three warehouses is reducing copper supply available to the market, and because it's a peak season for copper cable production in China, we're definitely going to be affected."
"This is the old warehouse play," Mark Woehnker, president of AmRod Corp., said of the concentration of copper stockpiles in some regions. "It's a very disconcerting development." The Newark, N.J., company melts copper sheets to form rods.
In comments at a copper conference in Chile, LME Chief Executive Martin Abbott said the warehousing issues were the result of market conditions beyond the exchange's control. The LME declined to comment further.
The LME has taken steps to address bottlenecks in the system. Last year, it doubled the minimum amount of metal warehouses were required to deliver each day. This month, it began requiring warehouses to deliver more than one type of metal each day.

Full text:   A closely watched deal under which a state-run Chinese bank would have provided $1.7 billion for two huge housing developments in San Francisco collapsed after changes in bank leadership and U.S. tax laws complicated negotiations, according to a person familiar with the talks.
U.S. home builder Lennar Corp. had been in talks with the China Development Bank for more than a year about a loan to finance some 20,000 new homes and millions of square feet of commercial space on the site of two former naval bases, Treasure Island and Hunters Point Shipyard.
In December, a bank committee approved the loan, which required Lennar to work on the project with China Railway Construction Corp., a state-run contractor. China Railway's role was never made clear, but the company opened an office in San Mateo, Calif., and had been meeting with local construction officials.
China Development Bank officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Lennar and the bank had been trying to close the loan to avoid potential costs arising from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires foreign banks to disclose certain data about American account holders or be subject to a 30% tax on income from their U.S.-held assets.
Another issue causing delay was the potential for a shift in China Development Bank's leadership. The bank's chairman, Chen Yuan, at 68 years old, is past retirement age.
Miami-based Lennar Corp., the third-largest U.S. home builder, was picked in 1999 to develop Hunters Point, a shipbuilding site in World War II. Its plan calls for 12,500 homes, a hotel, 3.5 million square feet of research-development and commercial space and 800,000 square feet of retail space.
On Treasure Island, a man-made island in the middle of San Francisco Bay, Lennar is partnering with several local developers and private-equity firms to build up to 8,000 homes, a hotel and commercial space.
Both developments had struck agreements with local trade unions to use local labor to build the houses and commercial properties. Tim Paulson, executive director of the San Francisco Labor Council, said last month that talks between Lennar and the Chinese seemed to be taking a long time.
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee visited China from late March until April 7 to promote the city's relationship with China. Local news reports before he left suggested he planned to discuss the Treasure Island and San Francisco projects with Chinese bank officials. Mr. Lee's office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
News the deal had collapsed was first reported on the web site of the San Francisco Chronicle.
The collapse of the talks with China Development Bank raises questions about the projects' future. Lennar has begun construction of the Hunters Point project but will need to come up with another financing source to pay for the bulk of both projects.
"We are continuing to move forward with development of Hunters Point Shipyard and are expecting to start home construction this summer," a Lennar spokesman said. "At the same time, lenders continue to have significant interest in financing the Shipyard and Treasure Island, which they believe are extremely attractive projects."

Full text:   BEIJING -- Economists raised fresh doubts about China's export data after figures for March showed a surprise trade deficit, with some suggesting the performance of the country's crucial export sector might have been weaker than it appeared.
A number of economists have questioned a surge in Chinese exports in recent months despite continued slow growth in regions that purchase Chinese exports and the Chinese currency's appreciation. They say the figures have likely been inflated by those trying to skirt China's capital controls and bring hot money into the country to take advantage of the strengthening yuan.
If demand for China's exports is partly a mirage, as these economists suggest, it not only means expectations for China's own recovery may have to be tamped down: China's strong performance in the last quarter had fueled hopes about a pickup in global demand.
The strict limits on the amounts of money that can be either taken into or out of China have fostered a variety of strategies to skirt them. Two businesses or individuals could agree to exaggerate or understate the value of a transaction in deals that can serve both outsiders eager to get capital into China for investment purposes and those based on the mainland who want to move some of their money out.
After reporting strong trade surpluses since December, China said Wednesday it swung to an $884 million trade deficit amid higher imports and slower export growth. In February, China posted a $15.25 billion surplus.
Exports rose 10% year to year in March, down from February's dramatic 21.8% rise. Still, some economists remained skeptical.
"This 10% export growth is more real as it's in line with other data such as power consumption, industrial production and transportation," said Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch economist Lu Ting in a research note. "That said, even the 10% reading in March might be overreported."
IHS Global Insight economists Xianfang Ren and Alistair Thornton called "astounding" a 93% year-to-year rise in March exports to Hong Kong -- where many exporters have close cultural and financial ties.
"The breakdown of exports by destination veers towards the absurd," they said in a note. By contrast, March exports to the U.S. and the European Union were down 6.5% and 14% respectively from a year earlier.
A spokesman for China's customs administration said Wednesday that the authority is investigating allegations of falsified data. "We will certainly take action if needed," Zheng Yuesheng said at a briefing on the trade figures.
Citing exporters, The Wall Street Journal reported last week that it has become common practice for some companies to overreport the value of exported goods. That results in bigger profits for exporters if the local currency rises in value. The yuan has advanced only about 0.6% against the dollar so far this year but a recovering economy could spell further gains ahead.
Exporters could also be falsifying documents to illegally claim tax rebates on their outbound shipments, according to people familiar with these trade practices. They also said some local governments claim higher export numbers to look good.
Though China typically runs a large trade surplus with the rest of the world, it isn't unusual for it to post a deficit in individual months. Trade figures have also been complicated by the Lunar New Year holiday, in February this year and January last year. Imports fell in February, likely due to the holiday, when much industrial activity slows.

The bipartisan agreement would require background checks for sales at gun shows and over the Internet. The deal boosts the chances of the Senate voting to expand the checks, but pushback from the NRA could make it difficult for some red-state lawmakers to embrace the accord.
Any gun measures that pass the Senate likely will face tougher resistance in the GOP-controlled House.

Full text:   CHINA
Banks Boosted Lending
Sharply in March, Data Show
China saw a large increase in lending in March, data released Thursday showed, reawakening concerns over inflation in the world's second-largest economy.
Banks made 1.06 trillion Chinese yuan ($171 billion) of net new loans, up from 620 billon yuan in February and well above expectations, despite pressure from the central bank to hold the line on lending.
While the growth of credit suggests strong economic momentum in China, it also raises concerns among economists of a resurgence in inflation and the prospect of asset bubbles, particularly in the real-estate market.
Consumer inflation fell back to 2.1% in March, after a holiday-induced spike in February, but economists warn that the latest lending figures suggest problems ahead.

Former Rail Minister
Is Charged With Bribery
Prosecutors charged China's former railway chief with bribery and abuse of power, state media said, moving closer to trial the case of a once-powerful official who came to represent China's pervasive government corruption.
The official Xinhua news agency said that the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court accepted a criminal indictment against Liu Zhijun. This paves the way for a civilian trial of the former minister at an unspecified later date. Mr. Liu's whereabouts isn't clear. He has made no public statements or appearances since being fired in early 2011.

YEMEN
President Overhauls
Leadership of Military
Yemen's president removed his predecessor's son and nephews from powerful security posts in the most dramatic step yet in sidelining old regime figures, according to the nation's state-run media.
Ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down in 2012, placed relatives and loyalists into top military and government posts over his 33-year rule. His vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, took over in a deal brokered by Yemen's Gulf neighbors and backed by the U.S.

SOMALIA
Piracy Declines Sharply
Piracy off Somalia's coast pushes up global trade costs by $18 billion a year, the World Bank said, but behind that figure is a sharp decline in recent attacks, bringing some relief to the East African nation.
In a report released Thursday, the bank said piracy amounted to a "hidden tax" on seaborne trade and a deep blow to the economies of both Somalia and its more stable neighbors. Still, attacks fell from a peak of 160 in 2011 to 49 last year, the International Maritime Bureau said.

MALAYSIA
Date of General Election Set
Malaysia set May 5 to hold what could be its closest general elections ever, pitting the National Front coalition and its decadeslong rule amid strong economic growth against the opposition and its pledge to boost living standards and create a corruption-free government.
The Election Commission said Wednesday that candidates will be nominated on April 20, kicking off a two-week campaign period that will send 222 lawmakers to Parliament. Last week, Prime Minister Najib Razak dissolved Parliament to make way for the election.

Full text:   CHICAGO -- Corn prices rose after the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast tighter-than-expected domestic supplies of the grain.
In the monthly crop report, the USDA raised its projection for supplies before this fall's harvest by 20%, to 757 million bushels. The forecast surprised some traders because analysts had projected a jump of 30%, on average, in a Dow Jones Newswires survey.
The government elevated its forecast for supplies on Aug. 31, the end of the current crop year, because it expects lower demand for corn from livestock companies and foreign importers. However, the USDA raised its projection for how much corn will be consumed by the ethanol industry.
Corn for May delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $6.49 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Corn prices fell earlier in the trading session because the USDA's forecast for global corn supplies was higher than analysts had expected. The USDA projected that global corn supplies will total 125.3 million metric tons this year, well above analysts' expectations. The agency raised its estimate primarily because of decreased demand for corn in animal feed in the U.S., as well as in China and Mexico.
"There's something for both the bulls and the bears out there today," said Chad Henderson, president of Prime-Ag Consultants Inc., a commodity brokerage in Brookfield, Wis. "At the end of the day today, the bulls won by a nickel."
Wheat and soybean prices fell Wednesday, as the USDA forecast significantly greater-than-expected world supplies of the two commodities.
CBOT May wheat settled down 12 cents, or 1.7%, at $6.9675 a bushel. May soybeans fell 2.75 cents, or 0.2%, to $13.9275 a bushel.

Full text:   BERLIN -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's whirlwind trip to Europe this week ended Tuesday, underscoring the stark trans-Atlantic divide over how best to recover from the global economic slump.
At four stops over two days, Mr. Lew pressed the Obama administration's view that Europe should go slower on its German-led austerity drive to avoid snuffing out the recovery. He also called on Germany to enact policies to boost consumer spending and on businesses to help revive growth.
"Global demand needs to grow," Mr. Lew said following his meeting here with his German counterpart. "Policies that would help to encourage consumer demand in countries that have the capacity would be helpful."
Many European governments are cutting spending and raising taxes to shrink budget deficits that ballooned after the financial crisis. Some, such as Greece and Portugal, have no choice under terms of international bailout agreements. Others, such as the U.K. and Germany, say they must pursue balanced budgets to ensure confidence in their public finances and stronger long-run growth.
The Obama administration and the International Monetary Fund have warned that the efforts, if pursued too rapidly, could be self-defeating by restraining growth, which could widen deficits and make government debts harder to pay. The outcome matters to the U.S. because its economy is closely linked to Europe's and could be hurt if the euro zone's financial turmoil escalates.
Mr. Lew, on his second official trip abroad after one to China, hinted on Tuesday that Europe should ease the pace of its austerity efforts until growth picks up, pointing to the improving economic picture in the U.S. The U.S. economy has expanded for more than three years, while growth in the euro zone is about zero. The U.S. has sought to "balance growth and fiscal discipline in a way that keeps our recovery strong," he said. "It has meant some midcourse corrections and extending the period of fiscal consolidation."
But Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, seemed unconvinced by the U.S. arguments.
"Nobody in Europe sees this contradiction between fiscal-policy consolidation and growth," said Mr. Schauble. "We have a growth-friendly process of consolidation."
U.S. officials say they see signs Europe is starting to make growth a bigger priority, partly because of the region's rising unemployment rate. The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area has hit a record 12%, but some individual members, such as Spain and Greece, are suffering more than twice that rate.
At a news conference with Mr. Schauble, Mr. Lew said pointedly that deficit reduction needed to be balanced with growth and investment policies. While growth targets may differ for different countries, he said, "I think it is fair to say that zero isn't a good target for anybody and negative is very bad."
Later, in Paris, his last stop before returning to Washington, Mr. Lew got more backing for the U.S. position from the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, who stressed the need for euro members to "maintain a balanced approach between repairing public finances and doing whatever necessary to ensure an economic pickup in the euro zone."
During his trip, Mr. Lew also pressed a range of other priorities of the U.S., including its view that Europe must urgently move to a system of regionwide banking supervision to prevent further banking crises, as well as coming negotiations over a trans-Atlantic free-trade pact.

Full text:   TAIZHOU, China -- The U.S. auto industry has long had three big domestic car makers. China has more than 170, including tiny Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co.
Jonway makes a sport-utility vehicle named after the Airbus A380 jumbo jet. Its A380 SUV starts at 70,000 yuan ($11,272) and is marketed as a smooth, low-maintenance ride.
Customers aren't buying it. Last year Jonway sold about 5,000 cars compared with the more than 7,000 that Volkswagen AG sells on average in China every day.
Little Jonway isn't fazed by the market reception. It plans to release a new SUV model this year, beef up marketing and is considering exporting vehicles to South America. It continues to work on its technology with the help of supportive local officials, and it just received a license from the Chinese government to begin making electric cars.
"China is the largest car market in the world, and it still has potential to grow. Our ambitions are congruent with reality," insists Alex Wang, Jonway's 31-year-old, U.K.-educated chairman.
Optimistic Chinese auto executives like Mr. Wang send shudders through the rest of the global auto sector. Industry watchers worry that the world's No. 1 auto market could soon be awash in overcapacity. That would rev up competition in China and pressure companies here to export more of their cars.
"We may see high levels of overcapacity and significant margin pressure within the next three to five years," said Bill Russo, president of auto consulting firm Synergistics Ltd. and a former Chrysler executive. He estimates that China's overcapacity in three years could total 10 million cars, roughly equivalent to Japan's 2012 auto production.
Overcapacity worries aren't confined to cars. China has a glut of factories in industries ranging from steel to construction equipment to solar panels. Beijing encouraged heavy investment in those industries to move away from its dependence on low-level manufacturing. While central government officials signal that they want to tamp down on capacity, local governments are still backing local champions that are major employers.
China's car-making capacity is set to soar in coming years. General Motors Co., Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co. are building new factories and assembly lines. China's top 10 auto groups -- which make both foreign and domestic brands -- are expected to have combined capacity to build about 35 million vehicles a year by the end of 2015, according to their previous announcements, compared with 18 million vehicles in 2012.
But sales growth is slowing. McKinsey & Co. forecasts that China's auto market will grow by an average 8% a year through 2020, down from a compound average rate of 24% between 2005 and 2011.
Experts expect domestic brands will incur the brunt of the slower gains because foreign brands such as GM and VW enjoy a reputation for quality among Chinese drivers. Foreign brands currently make up roughly two-thirds of China passenger car sales. Last year, Dong Yang, vice chairman of the semiofficial China Association of Automobile Manufacturers predicted about half of domestic brands may disappear in coming years.
But many Chinese companies enjoy subsidies designed to bolster local champions. For example, the western city of Chongqing said last June it would give a subsidy of up to 3,000 yuan for buyers of some models of vans made by local car maker Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., while FAW Car Co. said in August that the northeastern city of Changchun would offer a subsidy of between 3,500 yuan and 7,000 yuan for buyers of some cars made by the company. The U.S. last year filed a case before the World Trade Organization arguing that China unfairly supports auto companies and parts makers, an accusation Beijing disputes.
Many are also looking abroad. Last year Chinese auto exports rose 19% to one million vehicles, mainly to markets in the Middle East, Russia, and South America, according to the trade association.
Chinese officials have acknowledged the problem. In July, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said China has more than 171 car, truck and bus manufacturers, and said passenger vehicle producers that make fewer than 1,000 vehicles for two years in a row will be ordered to overhaul production.
China has auto makers even smaller than Jonway. According to research firm IHS, a company called Tianqi Meiya sold 77 passenger cars last year. The company, in the north Chinese city of Tianjin, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Jonway builds its vehicles in Taizhou, an eastern city where local officials are pushing to create their China's version of Detroit. According to a plan the city issued in 2010, officials committed to giving local auto makers land and helping them recruit talent, and it allowed banks to roll over loans to cash-strapped companies.
Other auto companies doing business in the region include Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., the Chinese auto maker which acquired Volvo Car Corp. from Ford Motor Co. in 2010.
Jonway's U.S. parent, a Santa Rosa, Calif., electric vehicle company called Zap, said in its most recent annual securities filing that the Chinese auto company received $1.6 million in subsidies and incentives in 2010 and 2011 combined. Jonway reported a 2011 loss of $10.2 million on sales of $54.3 million.
Mr. Wang's father and Jonway's founder, Wang Huaiyi, is a major Zap shareholder and a member of the board. The Wang family started its China-based business in the early 1980s, producing everything from buttons for clothes to parts of electric fans. In the 1990s it began supplying parts for motorcycles made by Geely before the latter began making cars.
Inspired by the high-profile success of Geely Chairman Li Shufu, in 2003 the senior Mr. Wang invested 600 million yuan, or about $72 million, in an SUV manufacturing facility with an aim at targeting China's growing middle class.
The younger Mr. Wang began managing Jonway in 2008 two years after returning from studying in the U.K. "I've never thought of the overcapacity problem," he said. Jonway "has done very well in the motorcycle business and it needs a bigger platform to grow. The car industry is just the platform through which we can grow stronger."
Jonway used Toyota Motor Corp.'s RAV4 SUV as a reference when designing the five-door A380, he said. Its sales grew to nearly 8,000 in 2010 from 4,500 the year before.
But sales began slumping in 2011 with China's decision to end buyers subsidies for cars with engine capacity of 1.6 liters or smaller. Mr. Wang said he believes the sales problem is marketing.
"Building brand recognition needs time," he said. "Jonway is in urgent need of improved marketing."
Jonway aims to sell 20,000 SUVs and minivans this year, and plans to add 50 dealers to its existing network of 100 dealers across the country. Other efforts include bigger dealer incentives, more advertising spending and a push to raise its profile at this month's auto show in Shanghai, he said.
It is also eyeing exports, targeting volume of 3,000 vehicles in emerging markets such as South America and Africa, Mr. Wang said. Jonway parent Zap has a team of Spanish-speaking sales representatives, "which is a unique edge to us."

Full text:   SYDNEY -- Australia and China agreed to allow each other's currencies to be directly converted, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said Monday. Starting Wednesday, the Australian dollar will be convertible into the yuan and vice versa.
Australia will be the third country to have such an arrangement, which is expected to cut costs for local companies doing business in China, Australia's biggest trading partner. Only the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen are directly exchangeable with the yuan.
The agreement eliminates the need for companies and currency traders to first convert their Australian dollars or yuan into U.S. dollars.
"This is a huge advantage for Australia," Ms. Gillard told reporters in Shanghai, flanked by executives from some of Australia's biggest banks. "It's a strategic step forward for Australia as we add to our economic engagement with China."
The Australian prime minister, on a five-day visit to China that began Friday, said the People's Bank of China already had approved licenses for Westpac Banking Corp. and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. to act as market makers for direct trading of the currencies.
"This takes costs out and makes it a whole lot more convenient," Gail Kelly, chief executive of Westpac, said at the news conference. Several major Chinese banks also are expected to be appointed as market makers, said a person familiar with the matter.
China introduced a yuan/Australian dollar exchange rate to its onshore currency market in November 2011, but trading of the pair has been done indirectly through the U.S. dollar. Some analysts said the new agreement would take time to change the shape of currency transactions between the two countries. Australia's exports to China are mostly bulk commodities, including iron ore and coal, priced in U.S. dollars. Few expect that arrangement to be altered soon.
Australian businesses have been slow to embrace the yuan, but that may be changing. Local companies sharply increased their use of China's currency for global trade payments late last year, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a global payments system.
Mike Smith, chief executive of ANZ, expects trading volumes to rise as a result of the new two-way agreement.
"It will become a proper traded currency mix and the volumes of that are limitless," Mr. Smith said at the news conference.
The close economic relationship with China has helped shield Australia from the turmoil in Europe and the fragility of the U.S. recovery. About 20% of the nation's exports go to China, with two-way goods-and-services trade between the countries valued at 128 billion Australian dollars ($133 billion) for the 2011-12 financial year.
Ms. Gillard's government has advocated a freer exchange-rate policy in China, arguing that such a move is vital to balancing global growth. Recent talks between the nations have been aimed at boosting yuan-denominated trade.
For its part, Beijing is slowly working to liberalize the yuan. In 2012, it allowed the currency to move within a wider daily range against the U.S. dollar.

Full text:   HANNOVER, Germany -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel dodged topless protesters and traded barbs over civil rights but largely stuck to business during a visit to a trade fair Monday.
Political disruptions were hard to avoid, even in the run-up to Mr. Putin's high-profile appearance at the annual Hannover Industry Trade Fair. German politicians and human-rights activists attacked what they called Moscow's repression of civic groups, its attitude toward gays and its support for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in that country's bloody civil war.
When the Russian and German leaders strolled through the spacious halls of the trade fair Monday, the protests became more tangible.
Three women charged the pair, ripping off their blazers to expose their breasts and profanities and the name of the punk band Pussy Riot written in black paint on their skin. The women were close enough to touch Mr. Putin before Russian security guards jumped into the fray and wrestled the protesters away.
Such protests, initiated by the Ukrainian group Femen, have become common wherever Mr. Putin appears. "We're used to these actions and I don't see anything terrible in them," he said. "If someone wants to have a discussion on some political issues then it's better to do it while you are dressed, and not take your clothes off."
While Mr. Putin laughed off the incident, worries about the erosion of democratic rights are no joke for the Germans. Ms. Merkel publicly reproached Mr. Putin for the treatment of German nongovernmental organizations in Russia, once in a speech Sunday before Germany's industrial elite and again at a news conference on Monday.
"It is important that an NGO can work well and free," Ms. Merkel said. Confiscating computer drives is a "disruption and intervention" of this work, she added. "A vibrant civil society can only emerge if individual organizations are able to operate without fear and worry."
Mr. Putin gave no ground to Ms. Merkel's pressure. He defended the wave of official audits of civil society groups over the past month or so as routine and part of Kremlin efforts to implement new laws that he said mirrored U.S. and European ones.
Analysts say one such Russian law, which requires any group that engages in anything seen as political activity to register as a "foreign agent," is much broader than Western analogs.
It is hard to imagine such a chilly greeting for a Russian leader under past German chancellors. Helmut Kohl enjoyed a warm relationship with President Boris Yeltsin. And Gerhard Schroder is still so close to Mr. Putin that he invited the Russian leader to his birthday party on Sunday evening.
Raised in Soviet-dominated East Germany as the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, Ms. Merkel has transformed Germany's relationship to Russia, putting it on a more businesslike footing. Much the way that Germany views China as a huge economic opportunity, Ms. Merkel stresses business rather than cultural ties to Russia.
"Putin and Merkel don't share a close personal relationship. They both know that the relationship is important, that business is the foundation of German-Russian relations," said Stefan Meister, an expert on Russia and Eastern Europe at the German Council on Foreign Relations. "The rhetoric in Germany's discussion of Russia has changed."
The question is whether Germany and Russia will go back to their old ways if Ms. Merkel is ousted from power in September's election. Her Social Democrat challenger, Peer Steinbruck, suggested recently that the West shouldn't impose its principles of pluralistic democracy on Russia.
But analysts think Germany may have soured on Mr. Putin's brand of strongman politics.
"There may not be a way back," said Mr. Meister. "There is a new fundamental debate about Russia in Germany today."

Full text:   U.S. soybean prices slumped to a fresh 10-month low amid fears that export demand for the oilseed will slow due to a bird-flu outbreak in China.
Traders worry the outbreak will lead to reduced poultry consumption in China and prompt producers to cull their flocks to prevent the spread of the new bird-flu strain.
A cutback in chicken production would result in lower demand for soybean meal, a widely used ingredient in chicken feed. Chinese state media reported Friday that six people have died after being infected with the H7N9 virus.
The outbreak comes as Chinese soybean imports already have been slowing and trail forecasts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, analysts said. China is the world's largest soybean importer, accounting for about 60% of imports, and its purchases have a huge impact on prices.
Soybean futures for May delivery fell 10.25 cents, or 0.8%, to $13.6175 a bushel Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade. That marked the lowest closing price for the front-month contract since June 5, 2012.
Soybean prices have dropped 6% since the USDA reported March 28 that U.S. supplies of soybeans, corn and wheat as of March 1 were all higher than analysts had expected.
The USDA report, along with sharp declines in corn futures and the emergence of the bird-flu outbreak, have led speculators such as hedge funds to exit from bets on rising soybean prices as they brace for more losses, analysts said Friday. Corn and soybean prices often move in tandem, as the crops are planted on the same ground across the U.S. Midwest and both are used in animal feed.
Analysts said the soybean market may remain under pressure as long as the weather is favorable for farmers, who are preparing to plant their crops in coming weeks.
"This is a liquidating market until we run into a crop problem," said Rich Feltes, vice president of research for R.J. O'Brien & Associates LLC in Chicago.
Traders expect U.S. farmers to dedicate more acreage to soybeans this year. Some say a chilly start to the spring may lead to even more plantings as farmers who had intended to grow corn switch to soybeans, which have a later growing season.

Full text:   BEIJING -- Concerns about a deadly new strain of bird flu intensified Friday as the disease claimed a sixth life in eastern China and agricultural authorities in Shanghai ordered a wide-scale slaughter of poultry in an effort to stem its spread.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned U.S. public-health departments and physicians to be on the lookout for signs of the new virus, a variant of the H7N9 strain of avian flu. The CDC said it is developing a diagnostic kit to send to U.S. states and China, and is working on a seed virus for a vaccine that could be prepared should the disease start spreading human-to-human.
Flu experts said they are concerned about the new virus because it exhibits signs of being more readily able to infect humans from ailing birds than is another form of avian flu known as H5N1, which has been infecting people off and on for more than a decade.
China now has confirmed 16 cases of H7N9 nationwide, with patients ranging in age from 4 to 87, who became ill between Feb. 19 and March 31. The number of cases, while small, is large for the early stages of an outbreak, and some flu experts said the fact that they are spread over a relatively wide geographic area is reason for concern.
Among the people found to be infected, several are believed to have been in close contact with birds, including a 48-year-old who transported poultry, a 45-year-old poultry butcher and a 38-year-old chef.
Authorities stressed they have yet to find a case of human-to-human transmission, which would make the disease more dangerous; the cases they have seen appear to come from human contact with birds.
"So far there is no evidence that the H7N9 virus can be spread between human beings, which makes us relieved," Wu Fan, director of the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday.
Chinese authorities are investigating illnesses in the families of two of the people who had confirmed H7N9, to see if any members have the disease -- a finding that could suggest human transmission.
Still, "the fact that we haven't seen cases in contacts and haven't seen it widespread in children" and elsewhere "are all reassuring," said U.S. CDC Director Thomas Frieden. The U.S. agency has worked closely with Chinese public-health authorities to improve the country's flu surveillance and lab testing in recent years, and Dr. Frieden said he had a "long conversation" Thursday night with his counterpart on the evolving situation.
No cases have been identified in the U.S. "There are no specific steps people in this country need to take to protect themselves," Dr. Frieden said.
Worries the new bird-flu strain in China will stifle air travel sent shares of the nation's airlines falling sharply, triggering a broader selloff in airline and travel stocks world-wide. Chinese flag carrier Air China Ltd. fell 9.8%, its biggest one-day decline since April 27, 2009.
Other governments in the region have made efforts to contain the disease. Hong Kong and Taiwan are stepping up temperature checks in airports, using sensors that screen passengers as they pass through a gate.
The world has become more than familiar over the past decade with avian flu, which typically circulates in birds and can jump to humans. The emergence and spread of H5N1 avian flu more than a decade ago prompted countries such as the U.S. to develop elaborate and expensive pandemic preparedness plans. H5N1 proved frighteningly deadly -- killing 60% of those it infected -- but despite infecting 622 people in 15 countries, it hasn't spread readily from one human to another.
Whether this new H7N9 flu, a different avian-flu strain, is deadlier than H5N1 isn't yet clear, because it isn't yet known how many people have been infected or how sick they are. Still, the new H7N9 is more worrying than H5N1 in some ways. Genetic changes in the avian virus suggest it may be adapting to infect mammals, said Nancy Cox, a virologist who is the CDC's Atlanta-based flu chief.
But she cautioned that little is still known about the new virus. The CDC hopes to receive a virus isolate or isolates from China within the next week or so, she said, and will study the genetic changes further to try to determine how transmissible the virus may be among humans.
Another challenge is that unlike H5N1, which can kill birds, this H7N9 virus doesn't make birds very ill -- so there is little sign it is spreading in flocks.
The appearance of the new virus has shaken China, where memories of the crippling 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome remain fresh. Unlike with SARS, the government has vowed to be transparent and release information as quickly as possible, though many in China remain skeptical.
China's state media and local governments have flooded social-media sites with information about H7N9, which scientists say may be susceptible to the two most powerful antiviral drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza.
Shanghai authorities moved Friday to destroy thousands of birds, ordering the closure of wholesale poultry markets and instructing vendors in smaller markets to immediately cull their chicken populations.
The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai issued a statement Friday urging people to remain calm. "At this point the risk for international disease spread is considered low," the consulate said. "The latest advisory from the World Health Organization as of April 4 is that no travel or trade restrictions with China should be applied based on the current information."

Full text:   BEIJING -- A discrepancy between China's export data and Hong Kong import numbers is raising doubts about what appeared to be booming overseas demand for Chinese goods, amid uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
China's customs bureau reported in March that exports rose 19.8% year-to-year in the three months through February, despite a fragile recovery in the U.S. and Europe. The report has buoyed confidence that China's economy is strengthening, after growth in gross domestic product touched a three-year low of 7.4% year-to-year in the third quarter of 2012.
But some exporters, trade agents and economists said the export numbers were likely to be inaccurate because of false reporting by exporters and local governments. They point in particular to mismatching trade figures with Hong Kong, the first destination for many mainland Chinese goods.
In the three months through February, mainland customs reported $94.9 billion in exports to Hong Kong, but Hong Kong customs reported only $58.7 billion in imports from the mainland. The discrepancy during the period was greater than at any other time in recent years.
China's export growth for February could have been overstated by around seven percentage points, based on an analysis of data discrepancies, Louis Kuijs, China economist at RBS, estimated.
Some exporters exaggerate invoices to gain tax rebates and evade controls on bringing cash into the country, and some local governments claim higher export numbers to look good, people familiar with reporting practices said. "Fake exporting is rampant," said an export-agency owner in Foshan, in southern Guangdong province.
"It's really easy to inflate export data if you want to," said a customs official in China's eastern Zhejiang province, an export powerhouse.
Chinese customs headquarters didn't respond to requests to comment. In the past, they have defended the data. "The customs data is based on invoices submitted by companies," the General Administration of Customs said in January. "Every dollar in the data corresponds to a real invoice," it said.
Hong Kong's Customs & Excise Department and Census & Statistics Department said failure to lodge an accurate export-import declaration could result in prosecution.
The exact reasons for the widening discrepancy aren't clear. Economists said the need to evade China's system of capital controls, which make it difficult to move investment funds in and out of the country, could be a powerful motivator. By labeling goods as valued higher than their real worth and sending them abroad, a person or company can bring in extra money from outside the mainland.
In the past few months, investors have had added motivation for evading controls. Mainland equity markets ended a weak 2012 with a strong rise, property prices began rising again and the yuan gained against the dollar.
Over-invoicing exports to bring funds into the country is common practice, said the chief executive of a U.S. sporting-goods company with factories in Guangdong -- adding that it isn't a practice the company follows.

Full text:   Global airline-passenger traffic remains on track for double-digit growth this year as a rebounding Chinese market leads broader expansion by carriers in Asia and the Middle East, according to industry data published Wednesday.
The growth in flying has almost doubled over the past five months from the sluggish rates seen in the first half of last year, though cargo traffic remains slack, and some big domestic markets -- including India and Brazil -- continue to shrink, the International Air Transport Association said.
The airline business is viewed as a leading indicator of broader economic growth, and the Geneva-based trade group said global passenger traffic in February rose 3.7% from a year earlier and was up 1.2% from January.
The gain outstripped the rise in airline capacity, pushing the average load factor -- the percentage of seats filled -- to a record high.
China's domestic market has driven the broader recovery, with traffic surging 20% in February, or 13% after stripping out the effect of the Lunar New Year, a prime time for leisure travel. Last year, the holiday fell in January.
Other big domestic markets continued to shrink, with U.S. carriers cutting capacity to boost their pricing power while cautioning that automatic government budget cuts are starting to hurt business.
US Airways Group Inc. on Wednesday reiterated a warning given by larger rival Delta Air Lines Inc. that the so-called sequester spending cuts in the U.S. government budget are hurting late bookings, which usually command higher fares.
U.S. carriers have led the global industry in trimming capacity to match demand, andAnalyst Daniel McKenzie at Buckingham Research Group on Wednesday flagged further cuts planned for the Northern Hemisphere's coming summer season, traditionally the industry's peak period for travel and earnings. "Capacity has come out of the industry and is mostly staying out," Mr. McKenzie said in a note to clients.
China's big airlines are leveraging their more robust home market to increase international growth. In the second quarter, Air China Ltd. is boosting the number of seats offered on flights to the U.S. by 55%, compared with a year earlier, while China Southern Airlines Co. is adding 73% more capacity, according to Buckingham.
Buckingham's analysis shows U.S. and European airlines returning to modest growth in the second quarter after shrinking in the first three months of the year, while big Middle East and Asian carriers plan more rapid expansion.
India's domestic traffic fell 9.1%.

Full text:   BEIJING -- The unusually robust U.S. measures to North Korea's latest threats have complicated the response of China's new leadership to Pyongyang.
Many observers see evidence that the leadership is increasingly frustrated by the failure of its North Korea policy, and concerned about the prospects of another military clash on its border. But those concerns are still outweighed by military commanders' desire to maintain Pyongyang as a strategic buffer against the U.S. -- a desire that has intensified as a result of the U.S. "pivot" toward Asia.
When Deng Yuwen, an editor at a prominent Communist Party newspaper, wrote an op-ed article titled "China should abandon North Korea" in February, it was hailed by many diplomats as a sign that Beijing was reviewing ties with its neighbor following the most recent nuclear test there.
But soon after the opinion column was published in the Financial Times, Mr. Deng was punished with a monthlong suspension from his job at the Study Times, according to people familiar with the matter.
On Monday, when contacted, Mr. Deng told The Wall Street Journal, "I can't accept interviews about this. Please understand the situation."
Mr. Deng's punishment highlights the conflicted response of China's new leadership to North Korea's repeated threats.
While several academics have called for China to downgrade ties, or reduce aid and investment, Mr. Deng went a step further in the February editorial and urged Beijing to pursue Korean reunification.
Beijing sees the recent U.S. moves to strengthen its missile-defense system and fly advanced bombers and fighter jets to South Korea as direct threats to its security interests. But it sees a greater threat in the prospect of North Korea collapsing or reunifying with the South, both of which it believes would help the U.S. to "contain" China.
China -- still by far the North's biggest aid donor, investor and trade partner -- has also long worried a regime collapse there would trigger a flood of refugees into northeastern China.
As a result, China is unlikely to adopt major changes to its North Korea policy, analysts and diplomats say.
Beijing has indicated its displeasure with North Korea's latest nuclear test by backing new U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang and slowing some cross-border trade with tighter customs inspections, the diplomats and analysts say.
Chinese customs figures show that exports of rice to North Korea dropped to zero in January, before rebounding in February, and crude-oil exports to the country also dropped to zero in February. With official data on crude-oil exports in March not yet available, it remains unclear whether those declines were cyclical, or the result of a policy decision in Beijing.
But even if those were punitive measures, many analysts say Beijing has taken such steps before with negligible effects on Pyongyang's leadership. They also say China is unlikely to go further this time given recent U.S. moves to bolster defense ties in Asia.
"North Korea ultimately knows that if it dies, China becomes more insecure," said Shen Dingli, vice dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai.
"At the end of the day, the DPRK [North Korea] is not China's enemy," said Mr. Shen, using the North's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Mr. Shen is one of the academics who have argued publicly in favor of downgrading China's relationship with North Korea. He and other Chinese international-relations experts say there is an unusually open debate going on in policy-making circles about how to redefine China's ties with North Korea.
But academics like Mr. Shen may have limited influence on party leaders, especially relative to the People's Liberation Army, which is preoccupied with ways to counteract U.S. military influence in Asia, according to several experts and diplomats.
Commentators linked to the Chinese military have taken a different tack, arguing that China should strengthen its relations with North Korea to counterbalance U.S. efforts to contain China through the strategic "pivot."
A recent commentary in the People's Liberation Army Daily blamed the U.S. for the instability on the Korean peninsula: "The main reason why North Korea is bent on developing nuclear weapons is basically the threat that the U.S. poses to its security."
General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University made a similar argument in a presentation at the University of Denver's Jackson/Ho China Forum in February, according to a video available online.
He blamed successive U.S. administrations for provoking North Korea into pursuing nuclear weapons. "They [the North Koreans] are poor," he said. "Maybe in their understanding, development of nuclear weapons is the best way to protect their national security."

Full text:   BEIJING -- More than a quarter of U.S. businesses in China said in a new survey that proprietary data was stolen from their China operations, highlighting a growing trade irritant between Washington and Beijing.
The survey of U.S. business executives released Friday by the American Chamber of Commerce in China showed that 26% had seen data or trade secrets stolen over an unspecified time period. More than 40% said they saw the risk of a data breach in their China operations rising. The chamber hasn't released surveys over data theft before.
The survey also showed U.S. businesses are increasingly worried about China's rising labor costs, slowing economic growth and the sluggish pace of economic reform, even as most said they remain optimistic about the near-term business outlook for the world's No. 2 economy.
The survey was taken late last year, before the U.S. began pressing China over accusations that state-sponsored groups were behind a series of hacking attempts on U.S. companies.
Christian Murck, the chamber's president, told reporters on Friday that data theft was "beginning to become public in a way that it hasn't in the past."
This month, U.S. National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon called on the Chinese government to stop what the Obama administration has said is a large number of hacking attacks against U.S. companies. China has repeatedly said it doesn't sponsor hacking and says China is often itself the victim of hacking attacks.

Full text:   SINGAPORE -- Amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, investor Jim Rogers is choosing sides -- financially, anyway: He is going long on rare North Korean coins.
But his reasons aren't likely to please Kim Jong Eun.
This weekend, at the Singapore International Coin Fair, a North Korean company will give collectors an unusual opportunity to buy the country's gold or silver minted coins.
It is unclear what Pyongyang-based Korea Pugang Coins Corp. will be peddling, though it sold gold coins last year. The company couldn't be reached for comment.
"They are very discreet and don't disclose much information," said a spokeswoman for the fair, who confirmed that the company booked a stand for the weekend, its second visit to the event.
According to North Korea's state-controlled news agency, gold coins were last minted in 2012 to commemorate Kim Jong Il, the country's leader who died in late-2011. The inscription: "The Great Leader Comrade Kim Jong Il Will Always Be Alive."
Mr. Kim was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Eun.
Whatever it is selling, Korea Pugang can be confident it will find a buyer in Mr. Rogers, an American commodities investor now based in Singapore.
Mr. Rogers, 70 years old, who started the Quantum Fund with George Soros in the 1970s, bought up the entire lot of North Korean gold coins offered last year.
"If the North Koreans come again, I will do the same," Mr. Rogers said. "Coins and stamps are the only way I can invest in North Korea."
By invest in, Mr. Rogers means he wants to wager against the long-term prospects for the isolated, economically struggling country. He views his purchase as a bet on the collapse of North Korea.
"At some point down the line, North Korea will cease existing as a country. Then the value of the coins will go up," Mr. Rogers said. He wouldn't say how many coins he bought last year or what he paid.
Mr. Rogers is a fervent believer that the commodities bull-run will continue and that China and other Asian nations will set the global economic agenda for this century. He advocates investing in frontier markets such as Myanmar and Cambodia, and in 2007, sold his New York mansion and moved to Singapore, in part because he thinks it is crucial for his children to learn Mandarin.
The coin fair follows a week in which North Korea cut the military hotline to its southern neighbor and put its rocket and artillery units on "highest alert." The threat came after the U.S. and South Korea signed a military contingency plan to respond to possible attacks from North Korea.
Trade sanctions prevent citizens of the U.S. and other countries from trading precious metals with North Korean government bodies, but the coin fair spokeswoman said Korea Pugang is a private company.
Although North Korea has minted gold coins regularly since 1987, the coins are rarely sold to international investors.
The coin fair is one of the most important in Asia and draws buyers from all over the world.
"I will take a look at the coins" on Friday, said William Ng, a coin collector for 30 years and owner of the William Ng Collections shop in Singapore. "I'm not sure I'd be able to sell them here in Singapore," he said, adding that he has never had any requests for North Korean coins.
Estonia-based Tavex Group, a firm that specializes in gold and currencies, made a deal with Pyongyang in 2008 to sell North Korean gold coins.
But the North Koreans ended it after the first shipment of coins from a 2007 series featuring elephants, rhinos, owls, lions and buffalos.
"We sold them at a relatively high price to collectors, but demand was not big," says Tomas Pavelson, who works in sales at Tavex Group.
"Actually, we still have one left."
Representatives of six gold dealers participating in this weekend's fair in Singapore said they had never bought or sold or even had any requests for North Korean coins.
At Oklahoma City-based Apmex, the largest online precious metals dealer in terms of sales in the U.S., no North Korean coins were on sale.
But on eBay, two North Korean one-ounce gold coins were on offer Thursday, from 1988 and 2002, at $2,790 each.
That is well above Thursday's closing gold price of $1594.80 an ounce.

Abstract: Negotiations are continuing on the U.S.'s conditions for blessing the Sprint deal, but the government is expected to require the companies to notify it when they plan to buy equipment for the core of their network and to cooperate if any national-security or public-safety considerations arise, the people familiar with the matter said. Because of concerns about violating trade rules, any constraints wouldn't specifically exclude gear from Huawei, which Softbank has used in its home market of Japan, or ZTE, a person familiar with the process said.

Full text:   The U.S. government is seeking oversight of network-equipment purchases as a condition for approving Softbank Corp.'s $20 billion acquisition of U.S. phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp., a move that appears to be aimed at keeping out Chinese suppliers like Huawei Technologies Co., people familiar with the matter said.
U.S. treatment of those suppliers has inflamed tensions between the U.S. and China, which are already sparring over accusations of computer hacking and trade issues. After the House intelligence committee concluded in October that Huawei and Chinese rival ZTE Corp. pose national-security risks because their equipment could be used for spying, China's Commerce Ministry lashed out, saying the report violated the U.S.'s free-market principles and warning it could undermine cooperation between the countries.
Negotiations are continuing on the U.S.'s conditions for blessing the Sprint deal, but the government is expected to require the companies to notify it when they plan to buy equipment for the core of their network and to cooperate if any national-security or public-safety considerations arise, the people familiar with the matter said.
Because of concerns about violating trade rules, any constraints wouldn't specifically exclude gear from Huawei, which Softbank has used in its home market of Japan, or ZTE, a person familiar with the process said. Nor would they explicitly give the government a veto, this person said. But U.S. officials have made no secret of their distrust of the Chinese companies and are aiming to make sure their equipment doesn't become a core part of U.S. telecom infrastructure, the people said.
"You have to find a way to say, 'Don't buy from the Chinese,' without saying, 'Don't buy from the Chinese,'" said a person who has spoken with Sprint.
Sprint and Softbank both declined to comment Wednesday. In interviews when their deal was announced in October, chief executives at both companies acknowledged U.S. concerns about Chinese suppliers.
Both companies are willing to forgo use of Huawei and ZTE gear in the core of their U.S. network, said the person who has spoken with Sprint.
Huawei and ZTE have denied they would let the Chinese government use their gear for surveillance. Huawei spokesman William Plummer said all vendors rely on global supply chains, and the company's products are used in nearly 150 markets, including almost every country in Europe.
"The adoption of such a policy would seem little more than a market-distorting political or protectionist exercise," Mr. Plummer said, referring to a review of equipment purchases that could exclude Huawei.
"It's a pity that U.S. carriers cannot use our equipment," said ZTE spokesman David Dai Shu. "We are trying to prove that ZTE's equipment is safe and poses no threat to U.S. security."
U.S. carriers are concerned that their options are shrinking as the Western telecom-equipment industry struggles. Huawei is the world's second-largest telecom-equipment provider behind Sweden's Ericsson, and ZTE is the sixth, according to technology-research firm IDC.
Much of the rest of the industry is under stress, with Alcatel-Lucent SA of France burning through cash and Nokia Siemens Networks having cut nearly a quarter of its workforce to stay competitive. Nokia Siemens Networks is a joint venture of Finland's Nokia Corp. and Germany's Siemens AG.
Huawei, which grew quickly by being a low-cost supplier, is now outspending most of its rivals on research and development, making it increasingly competitive on the technology front. While smaller U.S. operators use the Chinese company's equipment, the U.S. government has waved off major U.S. carriers.
In 2010, then-Commerce Secretary Gary Locke warned Sprint away from awarding Huawei part of a contract worth billions of dollars. Mr. Locke called Sprint CEO Dan Hesse to remind him of the U.S. government's security concerns, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
Now, U.S. officials are using this latest round of consolidation in the telecom industry to formalize their oversight of such deals.
The negotiations between Sprint, Softbank and the government are part of the national-security review required when a foreign company tries to buy control of a U.S. company.
Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Mobile USA unit and MetroPCS Communications Inc. went through the process when seeking approval for their merger. When the Federal Communications Commission approved that deal in March, the companies agreed to give the departments of Justice and Homeland Security 30 days notice before using a new vendor for network equipment. They also agreed to work out any national-security concerns the departments raise.
An FCC official said the language was requested by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security. The two departments declined to comment.
The FCC reviews all deals involving wireless carriers. But in cases involving a foreign buyer, the review is widened to a group including representatives of the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Such deals also must be cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, a secretive panel headed up by the Treasury. Analysts expect the government to approve Softbank's deal to take control of Sprint.
"We would be compliant with the policy of the U.S. government," Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son said in an October interview when asked about using Huawei gear. He added that more than 90% of the company's total capital spending involves suppliers other than Huawei and ZTE.
A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment, citing the confidentiality around Cfius cases.
The merged company also will likely have to create a subsidiary that handles Sprint's classified work for the government and agree to allow inspections of company facilities, isolate foreigners from certain sensitive parts of the network and require certain employee screenings, said people familiar with Cfius reviews.
The growing sensitivity toward Chinese equipment was evident in a little-noticed addition to a government-funding law signed Tuesday, in which Congress effectively banned federal dollars from being spent on information technology from companies "owned, directed or subsidized by the People's Republic of China."
One issue for Sprint and Softbank is that Clearwire Corp., a wireless company that Sprint is in the process of acquiring, uses some Huawei radio base stations to transmit phone calls and data.
Clearwire Chief Technology Officer John Saw said Huawei accounts for a small part of Clearwire's infrastructure, the company is reducing its use of Huawei gear and that every LTE base station will be tested to for security weaknesses. "It is important to point out that there are no longer any domestic suppliers for radio base station infrastructure equipment," he said. "Clearwire is committed to ensuring that our network and our customers' data are secure."

Full text:   Members of the Brics group of emerging markets took steps to trade their currencies more freely and to establish a joint development bank, seeking to counter the influence that developed countries exert over the global economy.
Brazil and China agreed Tuesday at a summit of Brics leaders in Durban, South Africa, to use their central banks to swap up to $30 billion in Brazilian real and Chinese yuan over the next three years, allowing businesses to trade between the two countries without converting earnings and investments to U.S. dollars, the standard conduit of global trade.
Brazil's finance minister, Guido Mantega, said the arrangement, which the countries have been working toward since this past June, would give them a means to exchange currencies "independent of the conditions of financial markets." He also said the Brics countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- were close to an agreement to pool some foreign-currency reserves in case of a balance-of-payments crisis.
The bloc's move to create a new development bank, however, was weighed down by disagreements over funding and management, said Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. "On the whole, we agreed that we will continue to work on creating a Brics bank once the unresolved questions are answered," the Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Siluanov as saying.
South Africa's finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, added that he was pleased with the negotiations. "We're on track," he said.
South African officials want a new development bank to fund infrastructure projects that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have overlooked. Larger Brics members, such as China and India, are eager to establish an institution that could extend their influence deeper into Africa and other emerging markets where their economic interests are expanding.
The Brics' slow march toward establishing their own bank illustrates their struggle to move past populist rhetoric to true cooperation between powerful and sometimes adversarial nations. Each is eager to reap the benefits of a larger trade group -- and all are fearful of being flooded with products from the others, particularly China.
"What we now seek to address jointly is to find the means towards a more equitable balance of trade," South Africa's President Jacob Zuma told reporters in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, after meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. "Africa is counting on the People's Republic of China for support in the continent's development."
Mr. Xi acknowledged China is pursuing its own commercial interests in Africa. "We each see the other side as an opportunity for our own development," he said.
According to the proposals discussed Tuesday, each country would likely contribute up to $10 billion to the bank, an official said, speaking before plans were to be approved by the national leaders gathering Wednesday. The bank would focus on infrastructure development, he said, both in the five-nation group and in emerging markets where they want to do business.
But economists and business leaders said an initial pool of $50 billion wouldn't be enough for the bank to make its mark in Africa or elsewhere.
"At this point it's somewhat symbolic," said Anthony Thunstrom, chief operating officer for accounting firm KPMG LLP's Africa investment program. "Its potential will only be realized when it's better capitalized, and I think that's going to be a longer-term project."
More specific decisions -- including which country will host the bank and where it will invest -- will be postponed at least until the bloc's next summit meeting in Brazil in 2014, he said.
"There is general agreement that there is a need for this," said the official involved in the negotiations. "Creating a multilateral institution takes quite a long time from being an idea to being set up."

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan and the European Union agreed to start negotiations on a free-trade agreement, after a decision by Tokyo to join talks for a U.S.-led pan-Pacific free-trade pact.
The announcement came as Japan and the EU try to spur their economies, which are struggling with fiscal crises and aging populations.
Japanese officials said they are looking beyond economic weaknesses in Europe and trying to strengthen partnerships with Europe's advanced economies to speed Japan's structural reforms.
Japanese trade officials said they hope to wrap up the talks in about two years. Japan is set to start trade talks with China and South Korea this week.
The rapid succession of trade talks partly represents an effort by Japan to catch up with South Korea, an economic rival that already has trade deals with the EU and the U.S. and is rapidly eclipsing Japan in areas such as electronics.
On Japan's wish list in European talks are the elimination of the EU's 14% tariffs on electronics and 10% tariffs on autos, both of which have put Japanese exporters at a disadvantage to their Korean rivals.
Japan also hopes a trade deal will attract more European companies to Japan and stimulate the domestic economy.
Europe has strength in areas where Japan faces severe challenges, such as electric-power supply, following the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
The talks had been expected to start in 2011; the delay is an indication of how contentious such trade pacts are in both Japan and EU.
The EU demand that Japan open its wine and cheese markets looks certain to invite opposition from Japanese farmers. Meanwhile, Germany is cautious that a free-trade agreement would mean a flood of Japanese cars into its market. The EU is Japan's fourth-largest export market after China, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the U.S., with a share of over 10%.

Full text:   Japan and South Korea are haltingly moving to mend their bruised relationship, encouraged by U.S. officials eager to maintain a united front of allies as China's influence rises across the region and as North Korea has stepped up its bellicose rhetoric.
Signs of a thaw have come as both countries have installed new leaders and as Washington has expressed growing impatience with repeated flare-ups over disagreements left unresolved since World War II.
Efforts to rebuild trust between Seoul and Tokyo -- which all but suspended top-level diplomatic dialogues last summer amid territorial tensions -- have been under way since January, soon after both countries' elections.
Eager not to let deep-seated bitterness over Japan's wartime record in Korea derail security strategies in Asia, U.S. officials have played a prominent role in encouraging better relations between the governments of South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
When Ms. Park was inaugurated in February, Japan's deputy prime minister attended as well as 30 members of parliament and three former prime ministers. A week later, Ms. Park and Mr. Abe talked, pledging to work together to implement United Nations sanctions against North Korea in response to its Feb. 12 nuclear test.
Momentum toward normalcy could build over the coming months. Senior officials from the two nations and China are set to kick off talks in Seoul on Tuesday for a trilateral free-trade agreement, an initiative that has endured tensions among all three nations. Leaders from the three are also expected to meet in South Korea in May.
"Japan and Korea are precious neighbors that share basic values and interests. We want to communicate frequently," Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters after talking to Yun Byung-se, his counterpart, on the phone last week.
Mr. Yun described Japan as "an important neighbor to work with for peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia." He said the two countries should take the opportunity of their new governments to enhance trust.
Such comments represent a change from fiery rhetoric late last summer, when former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited Korean-controlled islets that are also claimed by Japan and called them "worthy of sacrificing our lives."
Japan's then-prime minister criticized Seoul for "illegally" occupying the islands and Japan's parliament denounced the South Korean trip.
The inauguration of Ms. Park took Mr. Lee out of the equation and gave Tokyo a chance to approach the Korean side.
Added to that was pressure from Washington. Troubled by Japan's entanglements with both Beijing and Seoul, and alarmed by hawkish policies advertised by Mr. Abe and his party during their election campaign last year, U.S. officials repeatedly urged Tokyo to make efforts to normalize ties with Seoul.
In mid-January, shortly after Mr. Abe again suggested his government might rescind Tokyo's apology for the use of Korean sex slaves by its military in the early 20th century, Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asia at that time, flew to Tokyo with two other top Obama administration officials. The Americans warned Japanese officials not to bring up sensitive issues related to Japan's past with Koreans, saying it would further complicate the country's relationship with Seoul, people familiar with the meetings said.
Mr. Abe has generally kept mum on historical issues since taking office, while focusing on how to stimulate Japan's economy. In other steps, a senior lawmaker visited Seoul in early January, followed by a visit by a larger group of politicians.
But behind the signs of a thaw, serious animosities persist. Conversations between top officials have included remarks underlining a gaping divide in views over Japan's wartime activities. "The governments in both Tokyo and Seoul. . . know well that any concessions would risk them politically at home," said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
In Tokyo, opposition lawmaker Seiji Maehara, a former foreign minister, was similarly pessimistic. "I don't think we have a situation where Japan and Korea, and Japan and China, can talk to each other with trust," he said.
The potential for historical issues to derail security ties between South Korea and Japan was made clear last year when an agreement for the limited sharing of intelligence information by the countries' militaries was scrapped at the 11th hour because of objections raised by politicians in South Korea.

Full text:   [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
A member of China's monetary-policy committee says the country's foreign-exchange reserves are like a slab of meat on the block in the U.S.
Those choice words reflect fear that U.S. quantitative easing will lead to a falling dollar and higher inflation, chopping the value of China's $3.3 trillion stash.
That doesn't seem to have stopped China from making a record addition to its dollar reserves in January. Data from the U.S. Treasury show China added $51.3 billion to its dollar holdings, mainly in the form of Treasury notes and bonds. That tops a previous record of $36.9 billion in May 2008, when global imbalances were at their precrisis peak.
It also is a reversal of the trend in the past two years, when China's accumulation of reserves and dollar purchases slowed markedly. China added just $130.4 billion to its FX reserves in 2012, down from $461.9 billion in 2007.
The dollar share of reserves -- which are also allocated to euros, yen and other currencies -- appears to have fallen to about 49% from about 69% over the same period.
Record purchases of Treasurys in January suggest imbalances in trade and capital flows are back in play. China's trade surplus has returned to levels last seen in 2008. Capital, flowing out of the country for much of 2012, now appears to be flowing in, with the latest round of quantitative easing in the U.S. a contributing factor.
January's data overstate the scale of the reversal. Chinese firms were trying to unload dollars throughout the fourth quarter of 2012, but with the central bank staying out of the markets, there was no one there to buy.
The central bank seems to have waded back in at the end of the year -- perhaps to head off pressure for yuan appreciation, and suddenly accumulated several months of dollar inflows to invest.
The conclusion remains the same. Trade and capital inflows that fuel yuan-appreciation pressure have eased compared with the precrisis years, but they haven't disappeared. China's government complains about dollar depreciation and U.S. inflation cutting the meat from their FX reserves. But if Beijing wants to stop the yuan from rising, it will have to continue putting more on the chopping block.

Full text:   As rising labor costs push manufacturing of T-shirts, jeans and the like out of China, the country has been able to offset that loss by grabbing the high end.
And nowhere is that on better display than the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
When the switch is flipped each night for the span's two-year artistic light show, the electricity flows through sophisticated power devices made by Gary Hua's factory not far from Shanghai.
In the six years since it was founded, his company has grown to 1,000 employees, who last year made three million power-supply units for high-efficiency light-emitting diodes. The company, Inventronics Inc., expects to double production this year and export more than half that output.
Inventronics exemplifies China's shift toward producing the higher-end products that are fueling the country's export growth. China has been increasing exports in industries as varied as computers, car parts, high-technology lamps and optical-surgical equipment, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Chinese, European Union and U.S. trade data.
HSBC economists estimate that China's share of global exports increased to 11% last year, from 9% before the 2008 financial crisis and around 5% at the turn of the millennium.
Chinese employment in higher-value industries such as electrical- and communications-equipment production has jumped since 2008 and now exceeds employment in textiles, garments and leather making, says Royal Bank of Scotland economist Louis Kuijs.
High-tech goods are more valuable and are a bigger market than clothes. Over the past two years, Chinese exports to the U.S. of high-tech electronics, auto parts and optical devices rose 24%, to $129 billion, while exports of clothes and footwear rose just 5% to $47 billion.
A chunk of what is marked "Made in China" is made up of parts and design that originated elsewhere, making trade data a little fuzzy. The chips in Inventronics' LED drivers are from the U.S., for example.
But China's exports contain a rising percentage of materials that were made in the country, according to the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Mr. Hua, 48 years old, was educated in the U.S. and spent a decade there, starting an electrical-parts company. He returned to China in 1999 and came out of an early retirement in 2007 to create Inventronics.
He based the company in Hangzhou, about 110 miles from Shanghai, to tap a base of highly trained engineers and put the company's factory near its suppliers. That helps Inventronics develop new products rapidly and adapt them to customers' often narrow specifications.
"That's one of the key advantages of being located in China," Mr. Gua says.
A skilled labor force, a large domestic market and networks of suppliers have become important factors that rising wages or a stronger currency, which makes exports less cost-competitive overseas, won't snuff out quickly. And China's growing consumer market means that if higher costs make exports less profitable, manufacturers can sell more products at home.
China also benefits by comparison from rising labor and material costs in Southeast Asia and Latin America, says Mr. Kuijs, of RBS.
Talaris, which makes cash-sorting machines used by banks, last year moved production from Sweden to China, where the company employs 1,000 workers at peak production. The move has cut the cost to make each machine by more than 25% as quality has improved, the Hampshire, U.K., company says. The company's sorters and dispensers scan thousands of bills a minute while checking for counterfeits and recording serial numbers.
"You have a concentration of suppliers getting stronger and stronger and more competitive," says Talaris Chief Executive Paul Adams. Talaris considered locating its factory in Taiwan, South Korea or Southeast Asia, but China had the advantage of a web of parts suppliers that would compete with each other and keep prices low, he says.
Around 90% of the value of a Talaris cash sorter is produced within China. The sorter's high-tech sensors, which account for 10% of the cost, are made in Japan. But diodes, capacitors, steel and plastic pieces are produced in southern China's technology metropolis of Shenzhen for quick shipping 930 miles to Talaris's assembly and research-and-development facility in Shanghai.
"Labor was only a small component of decision making," Mr. Adams says. He estimates that parts account for 80% of each machine's cost, with the rest coming from labor and overhead.
Businesspeople outside China complain that Beijing gives unfair advantages to its companies through subsidies, cheap financing and by letting its currency rise more slowly than market forces would dictate.
And some people say that as China grabs a greater share of global trade, it isn't gaining ground as quickly as in the past. Earnings growth in China is slowing, indicating there will be less money to invest.
"When China exhausts its ability to waste domestic savings, people won't be as impressed by China's size," says Diana Choyleva, a China economist for Lombard Street Research.

Full text:   JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa joined a club called BRICS a few years ago to tighten ties with the world's largest emerging markets. Today, the embrace from outsize competitors in the club, particularly China, is suffocating South African manufacturers, executives say.
"Manufacturers need economies of scale, and we don't have that," said Stewart Jennings, chief executive of South African glassmaker PG Group Ltd. and chairman of the Manufacturing Circle, an industry group. "And I think China uses that to do what they want to do. They're the gorilla in BRICS. We're the runt."
The issue comes to light as South Africa hosts leaders from Brazil, Russia, India and China in the port city of Durban this week for a summit that aims to foster so-called South-South trade among developing economies. The bloc -- comprising Brazil, Russia, India China and South Africa -- has previously staked out positions to counterbalance American heft in the global economy.
BRICS nations have called for a global reserve currency to compete with the U.S. dollar; criticized the tight control the U.S. and Europe exercise over the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; and said they would create their own development bank.
But the most immediate impact for South Africa has been to expose glaring weaknesses in its own economy, foreshadowing risks other African countries face as BRICS nations step up trade on the continent.
Chinese President Xi Jinping began a tour of Africa on Sunday during his first trip abroad, where he signed more than a dozen trade and cooperation deals with Tanzania.
To be sure, economists say South African manufacturers would be in even worse shape if their country hadn't joined the BRICS. The sector provides 15% of South Africa's gross domestic product and a million jobs -- more than a 10th of the workforce in a country with an official unemployment rate of 25%.
Buffeted by rising wage and utility costs unrelated to competition from BRICS countries, manufacturers have shed 85,000 jobs over the past three years.
Like other African countries, South Africa also is hobbled by a costly, undereducated workforce and neglected infrastructure that leave manufacturers vulnerable to imports from abroad. African business leaders say the continent's fragmented economies are just too small to contend with the manufacturing might of the BRICS, especially China.
"It's a serious threat to our factories," said Andries Tshabalala, executive director of Actom (Pty.) Ltd., a maker and distributor of electrical equipment. After customers switched to cheaper Chinese imports, Actom scaled back several product lines. "South Africa just can't afford to lose these jobs," he said.
South Africa was never supposed to be part of the club.
The group grew out of Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill's bet that those big emerging economies were poised to challenge traditional powers like the U.S. and Germany as global leaders. The countries invited South Africa to join the annual summit beginning in 2011, largely to have a representative from Africa in the club.
South Africa hasn't kept up with its new peers. In the past three years, South Africa's rate of growth has been the bloc's slowest by a full percentage point. In recent weeks, its currency fell to four-year lows -- outpacing declines of other emerging-market currencies -- as concerns have mounted over South Africa's economic outlook and political stability.
South Africa's BRICS membership hasn't come with any market-opening obligations, but manufacturers complain the government hasn't fought very hard on their behalf, either. As a result, imports from member countries to South Africa rose 25% annually over the past two years, while South Africa's exports to them rose just 13%.
South Africa runs a trade deficit of nearly $1 billion with Brazil, for example, and last year chicken farmers complained that cheap imports from the South American country were killing their business.
When South Africa imposed steep tariffs, Brazil complained to the World Trade Organization, and Pretoria backpedaled. In December, Trade Minister Rob Davies dropped the tariffs, saying the government would instead investigate a "comprehensive strategy" that didn't target any one country.
South Africa's lone stainless-steel manufacturer says it also confronts hurdles abroad that its competitors don't face to enter South Africa. "Anybody can send their steel here with no duties, yet in a lot of these other countries we face quite significant duties of up to 25%," said Dave Martin, CEO of Columbus Stainless (Pty.) Ltd. "Our government is a lot slower to take decisions on trade issues, for fear of upsetting very large trade partners."
South African officials say they want to change the trade balance dynamic. The country's biggest trade deficit is with China, a figure that reached $4 billion last year.
"We are where we are but that's not where we want to be," Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said in an interview last week.
He said he planned to lobby fellow BRICS nations for more balanced trade between those countries and all of Africa.

Full text:   [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
In the fight for Hess, the son of the oil company's founder stands in one corner. Opposite is an activist hedge fund not known for taking prisoners. Other shareholders are caught in the middle.
Might a mediator come from Norway, of all places?
Elliott Management, which owns 4.4% of Hess, is pushing the company to break itself up and aims to put five directors on the 14-member board when shareholders meet in May. Hess, whose Chairman and Chief Executive John Hess effectively controls just over 10% of the company, has responded with a plan to sell assets, return cash and appoint six new directors.
Both plans carry risk. Elliott's governance reforms are welcome, but its break-up plan is complex, and several analysts have expressed doubts about the viability of the proposed mainly international business.
Hess's counterattack offers benefits in the form of accelerated streamlining of its business and some new blood on the board. Still, investors would have to maintain faith that Hess could deliver despite a weak governance record and years of lagging shareholder returns.
But there is an alternative: selling Hess outright.
A standard reason for selling is the realization a company's assets might be worth more if run by someone else -- something activist campaigns can crystallize. Hess has some desirable assets, particularly in the Bakken shale formation, Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Asia's Malay Basin.
But, recent success in Ghana aside, its exploration record has been poor. And in 18 of the past 20 quarters, its main exploration-and -production business has ranked no higher than fourth out of a peer group of seven in terms of return on capital employed, a key measure of whether a company is creating value, according to Doug Terreson, analyst at ISI Group. Those peers include Apache and Devon Energy.
The result: For most of the past decade, Hess's stock has traded at wide discounts to the average for the same peer group in terms of price to cash flow, an important metric for the capital-intensive oil sector.
Despite its valuation gap, no one has stepped up to buy Hess, most likely because it wasn't perceived as being for sale.
But a bidder could emerge if shareholder sentiment was seen to be turning against the current board in the run-up to May's meeting.
Granted, broken up, Hess's separate pieces would make easier mouthfuls for a range of companies.
For the U.S. assets, these could include western majors and E&P companies, such as Continental Resources. For the rest, national oil companies from China and elsewhere might be interested.
While this ultimately could yield a higher total price, it also is riskier given the complex sale process.
A sale of the whole company would be preferable, even if Hess's scale and U.S. identity would limit the pool of potential buyers.
Assuming a 30% takeover premium, Hess would carry a price tag, including assumed net debt, of about $39 billion.
That would equate to a share price of about $91. On Friday, the shares closed at $70.27.
Western majors, including the usual suspects of Chevron and possibly Exxon Mobil, could be natural buyers for the whole company. But one other intriguing possibility is Norway's Statoil, which is 67% state-owned.
Hess's portfolio would tick several boxes for Statoil.
The Norwegian giant made a splash in 2011 when it agreed to buy Brigham Exploration for $4.4 billion. The acquisition gave Statoil positions it operated itself, as opposed to passive stakes, in the Bakken shale.
Buying Hess would augment this and further Statoil's strategy of reducing its dependence on its home country, which in 2012 accounted for two-thirds of its output.
Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, believes Statoil, along with BP, is one of the more-likely candidates among European oil majors to consider acquisitions.
That is due in part to its high exposure to offshore fields that tend to see steep declines in output over time. This puts an onus on securing long-lived reserves, such as shale assets.
Indeed, at just 7.4 years, Statoil has among the lowest proved-reserves life of the major oil companies.
Owning Hess would boost that to almost eight years. Other Hess assets, notably its stake in Norway's Valhall field and its operated projects in the Gulf of Mexico, also would fit well. Statoil declined to comment.
And if the $5.7 billion valuation Deutsche Bank puts on Hess's logistical, refining and marketing assets is stripped out, then Statoil would be paying about $21 for each barrel of oil equivalent of proved reserves.
That is less than Statoil spends to find and develop reserves itself.
At just under half Statoil's own enterprise value, including net debt, of $88 billion, buying Hess at a 30% premium would be a stretch, but manageable. Statoil's net debt to estimated 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization would rise but still be less than one times, before factoring in any cost savings or likely asset disposals.
Assuming a cost of debt of around 5.5% -- higher than where Statoil's current debt trades -- the deal also would boost Statoil's earnings per share in 2013 by about 9%, based on current estimates for both companies.
For Hess's shareholders, a takeover price of about $91 a share would still be below the bottom end of Elliott's theoretical, and optimistic, break-up valuation of about $97 to $126.
But it would be the highest price Hess's stock has commanded since September 2008 and also substantially higher than the $49 to $55 range where Elliott likely bought most of its stake.
And if it avoided a protracted battle, as well as the risks around the current two opposing plans, shareholders should welcome a bid.

Full text:   Tiffany & Co., which posted lackluster sales for its fiscal fourth quarter, expects to muddle through a rocky start for the current year before business picks up.
The high-end jewelry retailer said earnings for its fourth quarter rose just 0.7% from prior-year results that were weighed down by costs to relocate its headquarters.
Investors appeared encouraged that the jeweler reiterated its full-year forecast despite expecting a soft first quarter. Tiffany's shares rose $1.32, or 1.9%, to trade at $69.23 in 4 p.m. trading Friday.
The company's Asian-Pacific region continued to be a stronghold, with sales rising 13% to $254 million in the fourth quarter. Openings of stores in China, Singapore and Australia assisted revenue growth.
Analysts applauded the jeweler's efforts in Asia. "It's a growing market and you aren't seeing momentum domestically or from Europe," said Leigh Drogen, chief executive of Estimize, which compiles analysts' estimates.
Total sales in the Americas rose 2% to $620 million. Sales at the New York flagship store, which makes up 8% of overall business, fell 3%. Total sales in Japan declined 6% to $192 million.
The company forecast fiscal 2014 earnings from operations of $3.43 to $3.53 a share on 6% to 8% sales growth. Analysts have projected $3.50 a share on a 6% revenue increase to $4.04 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
Tiffany's "second half should be stronger than the first half as improved product innovation and marketing begins to take better hold," said Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen.
Tiffany warned that it expected fiscal-first-quarter adjusted earnings to decline about 15% to 20% because of gross margin pressure and higher marketing-related costs, while analysts were looking for flat profit. The company predicted earnings growth in subsequent quarters.
High-end shoppers have continued to snap up Tiffany's fine jewelry, such as canary-yellow diamonds and engagement rings.
But sales of silver jewelry -- which carry a higher profit margin than fine jewelry -- have declined of late as the retailer's less well-heeled customers have been affected by a weak economy, less-expensive knockoffs and what some people have considered a stagnant selection.
Tiffany has plans for an Art Deco collection of silver, onyx and freshwater pearls this spring, as a less-expensive complement to 1920s-style platinum and diamond jewelry it recently created. It also has been developing new products including a new metal alloy -- a mix of gold, silver and copper it calls Rubedo. Tiffany jewelry fashioned from the pink-hued metal start at $250.
For the quarter ended Jan. 31, Tiffany reported profit of $179.6 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $178.4 million, or $1.39 a share, a year earlier. Last year's earnings were $3.60 a share excluding costs to relocate Tiffany's New York headquarters staff.
The company's November projection was for earnings of $1.35 to $1.55 a share. In January Tiffany said it would come in at the bottom end.
Sales increased 4.1% to $1.24 billion, short of the $1.25 billion forecast by Wall Street. Excluding the effect of foreign-currency translation, sales rose 5%.
Same-store sales were flat.

Abstract: Mr. Malkin, 79, and his 50-year-old son, Anthony, have been trying for months to sell Mr. Kramer and about 2,800 other stakeholders on a sweeping deal to make the 102-story tower the centerpiece of a new public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In the 1990s, Japanese billionaire Hideki Yokoi bought the building, and his family recruited Donald Trump to lead an effort to break the long-term lease and seize control.\n

Full text:   Marshall Kramer, a 76-year-old retiree in Katy, Texas, picked up his phone recently and was surprised to hear the voice of Peter Malkin, whose family controls the Empire State Building.
Mr. Kramer and his two siblings own just one of the 3,300 shares in a private company that owns the famed skyscraper. Mr. Malkin was calling to persuade him to support the Malkin family's plan to take the company public. "I basically got a speech," recalls Mr. Kramer. "He sounded like a pushy salesman."
Mr. Malkin, 79, and his 50-year-old son, Anthony, have been trying for months to sell Mr. Kramer and about 2,800 other stakeholders on a sweeping deal to make the 102-story tower the centerpiece of a new public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It would be the second-largest IPO ever for a U.S. real-estate investment trust, or REIT, according to data provider Dealogic.
The Malkins need 80% support to proceed with the $1 billion offering. On Friday, they told owners they were extending the voting period, which could have closed on Monday. The Malkins said they may end voting when a New York State Court issues a ruling on one aspect of the plan, which is expected by May 2.
If the Malkins succeed, it will mark the end of a long and colorful era in the building's history that featured some of New York's best-known real-estate tycoons, a convoluted ownership structure and enough strife to keep lots of lawyers busy for years. The proposed deal was triggered by the 2007 death of Leona Helmsley, whose late husband, Harry, teamed up with Peter Malkin's father-in-law after the latter bought the building in 1961.
But first Anthony Malkin, who now runs the family company, must overcome resistance from some skeptical stakeholders -- many of whom inherited shares purchased a half-century ago from his grandfather, Lawrence Wien.
Mr. Kramer, for example, says he and his siblings got their ownership unit from their father, who told them he used to play gin rummy with Mr. Wien and was a friend of Harry Helmsley. Mr. Kramer says he recently voted "no" on the plan because he thinks it gives too big a share of the new company, which also will own 18 other Malkin properties, to the Malkin family and not enough to other stakeholders.
Anthony Malkin recently informed stakeholders that about 60% of the ownership units already had approved the plan. One supporter, Eli Mattioli, a lawyer who used to work with Mr. Wien, says the deal will bring the ownership structure "into the 21st century." Another, retiree Edward Bermas, says he thinks he'll make more money from the REIT. "I think the people who oppose it are more concerned with how much money other people are going to make," he says.
The proposed deal values the skyscraper itself at $2.3 billion, and the other 18 properties at $1.9 billion. The terms call for the Malkin family to own about 16.5% of the new Empire State Realty Trust, worth about $700 million. The deal values the Helmley estate's holdings at $1 billion; about two-thirds would be distributed as cash. The other Empire State Building stakeholders will own 24%, worth about $1 billion, and owners of the other properties will also get shares.
The Malkins have told stakeholders in writing that the proposed new ownership structure offers them fair value, and several advantages over the current structure. The new publicly traded shares, they say, will be more able to appreciate than units in the private company, for which there is no established trading market today. Investors who want to cash out can simply sell their shares. They also say the addition of the other buildings will make for a more diversified investment.
Currently, most units of the private company are worth about $323,000, according to the prospectus. Each year, those units receive a cash distribution based partly on whether the building's profit clears certain thresholds. Last year, the payout per unit was $5,199. The prospectus says that under the REIT structure, the comparable payout would be $5,866 in the first year.
The deal would do away with the final remnants of a Byzantine ownership and management structure that gave rise to years of feuding. After Mr. Wien bought the building in 1961, he set up a company to hold a lease on the entire building, selling stakes in that company -- the units now at issue -- for $10,000 apiece. Messrs. Wien and Helmsley set up another company to operate the building -- and share the profits. Then they resold the building itself to a big institutional investor.
In the 1990s, Japanese billionaire Hideki Yokoi bought the building, and his family recruited Donald Trump to lead an effort to break the long-term lease and seize control. At one point, Mr. Trump referred to the building as a "high-rise slum." Anthony Malkin and his father thwarted that effort.
Mr. Trump now is now complimentary of the Malkins, but characterizes the IPO plan as "a very complicated deal. Sounds to me like this is something that will end up in court, no matter what you do."
Separately, the Malkins were involved in litigation with Leona Helmsley -- nicknamed the "Queen of Mean" in New York -- and Helmsley-Spear Inc. over the contract to manage the building, a battle the Malkins won in 2006. The Malkins also arranged for the company holding the long-term lease to buy back the building from the Japanese ownership group.
Ms. Helmsley died in 2007. Her will stipulated that her interests in the Empire State Building should be liquidated.
Around that time, Anthony Malkin began overseeing a more than $550 million renovation of the building, which was erected in 1931 during the Great Depression, including restoring the Art Deco lobby and replacing all 6,514 windows. He also allowed leases to expire so he could combine spaces and attract higher-paying tenants. He lured Air China and French fragrance maker Coty, and social-networking company LinkedIn more than doubled its space.
The offering prospectus doesn't disclose past performance but projects the skyscraper's net operating income will increase from $84.3 million in the fiscal year ending June 2013 to $135.9 million for the year ending June 2015.
The Malkins have spent much of the last year trying to drum up support for the IPO plan.
Howard Peskoe, a New York lawyer, says he and his wife voted "yes." He cites the ability to trade the new shares and cash out after years of holding an illiquid asset. "The Empire State Building is a magical place, but it was a second-rate property," Mr. Peskoe says. "The Malkins brought it up to modern standards."
If Mr. Malkin doesn't secure the necessary votes, he can push back the voting deadline to as late as the end of 2014 as he negotiates with holdouts.
For months, the plan's detractors have been raising questions about terms of the deal, from whether the Malkins are shortchanging other owners to the tax ramifications to stakeholders. Last year, the Malkins settled a lawsuit brought by stakeholders over terms of the deal. The case now before the New York court is over a challenge to one aspect of the voting procedure.
Some of the criticisms have gotten personal. "Tony [Malkin] treats the Empire State Building like it's his property and we are just another piece of it," complains stakeholder Andrew Shact, whose says he grandfather was on social terms with Mr. Wien. Mr. Shact says he voted "no."
Anthony Malkin has said to investors that his critics are misinformed about details in the plan and are confusing other owners with misrepresentations.
Robert Machleder, a stakeholder and former law partner of Mr. Wien, says he called Peter Malkin last month to object to a stipulation in the IPO plan that awards $300 million to the Malkins as part of profit-sharing arrangement related to the Empire State Building and the other properties.
Mr. Machleder says he told Mr. Malkin he was going to share his thoughts with other owners. He says he was taken aback when the Malkins sent out a letter, labeled "Misinformation Alert," that defended the $300 million and seemed to cast doubt on Mr. Machleder's motives. "Certain individuals have intentionally waited until the last minute, in some cases for years, to attempt to disrupt your vote," the letter said.
Carol Green is a retiree who owns two units. "As the Empire State Building gets better, it's going to earn more," she says, which would mean that her payouts would go up under the current arrangement. She says uncertainty about what will happen to the value of a public stock caused her to vote "no."
"I don't know if the REIT is going to go up," she says.

Full text:   China surpassed Japan in 2012 to become the world's second-largest movie market, behind the U.S., with box-office receipts in the world's most populous nation up 36% to $2.7 billion.
The new data, contained in a report released Thursday by the Motion Picture Association of America, underscores the growing importance of China to Hollywood's studios despite the ongoing challenges they face in exporting their movies there.
Last year, concerned that foreign films were taking too big a share of box office, the government-controlled China Film distribution company released some big Hollywood movies on the same date, limiting their commercial potential.
Among the blockbusters pitted against each other were "The Dark Knight Rises," from Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures Entertainment's "The Amazing Spider-Man."
In the U.S., those films opened more than two weeks apart. China Film also imposed several "blackout periods" during which no foreign films were allowed to play in theaters.
On a conference call with reporters, MPAA Chief Executive Chris Dodd said such issues are "still a concern" and that his Hollywood studio trade group has "raised our concerns about that with the very highest authorities we have access to."
China enjoyed the fastest growth of the world's top 10 movie markets, an MPAA spokesman said. Total global box office rose 6% to $34.7 billion, thanks to increases Latin America, North America and the Asia Pacific region.
But declines in France, Italy, Spain and other countries hurt receipts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which fell 1% to $10.7 billion.
Box-office receipts in the U.S. and Canada rose 6% to $10.8 billion, as 1.36 billion tickets were sold, 80 million more than in 2011. The average ticket price rose less than 1% to $7.96, after at least nine years of steeper price hikes. Admissions fell in both 2010 and 2011, and are down more than 10% since 2003.
Last year's positive news hasn't continued so far this year, however, as flops like "Jack the Giant Slayer" and Arnold Schwarzenegger's "The Last Stand" have helped to drive domestic receipts down 12% so far compared with the same period in 2012.
John Fithian, CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners, blamed the decline on a lack of diversity in the offerings from studios, saying there have been too many R-rated movies. Based on the films planned for future release, he said he expects that negative trend to turn around by the end of 2013.

Full text:   Concrete has gone far beyond sidewalks and fallout shelters, and now it's increasingly popular in home decor. "People are becoming more attracted to concrete, and I think it has a lot to do with the possibilities it offers," said John Strieder, editor in chief of Concrete Decor Magazine, which started in 2001.
Manufacturers and artists are experimenting with engineered mixes, swapping aggregate materials for fiberglass and polymer and adding colors and textures, Mr. Strieder said. Certain mixes produce a thinner and lighter product than traditional concrete, allowing designers to venture beyond countertops and flooring to smaller furniture pieces such as coffee tables and lounge chairs.
Last week, around 2,000 architects, retailers and curious homeowners gathered in Charlotte, N.C., for the fourth-annual Concrete Decor Show, which showcases the newest technology and products in the industry. Here are some concrete examples.
GAME ON
James DeWulf, a 37-year-old Los Angeles designer, was turned on to concrete after seeing someone build prison beds at a concrete shop in 2004. Today, he's best known for his concrete ping-pong table, which sells for $7,000. Mr. DeWulf, who owns James DeWulf LLC, recently designed a pool table, which costs $16,000 for the indoor version and $18,000 for the outdoor version. Concrete has become a more acceptable furniture material, Mr. DeWulf said, because advances in the material have made it lighter, stronger and more stain resistant. "And ours has this beautiful, buttery finish. At trade shows, everyone that walks by runs their fingers across the table."
CLIMBING THE WALLS
While most of its clients are universities and sports centers, it's not unusual for Entre-Prises Climbing Walls to get requests for residential projects. "Rock-climbers are pretty passionate, and many are looking for that natural-stone look," said Jason Stollenwerk, who manages the U.S. operations in Oregon for Entre-Prises, which also has offices in France, England, Germany, Spain and China. The company offers a range of products, from 4-by-4-foot panels for $400 that clients can self-install, to custom interior projects that cost upward of $100,000. They even have a product that looks like ice. "It's a dense material that you can actually use ice-climbing tools on," he said, "for the die-hards."
TRIAL BY FIRE
As concrete cements its place in the high-end-decor market, it has also become a thrifty alternative to pricier stones such as limestone and marble. Scott Sterling, who runs a pre-cast concrete business in Santa Ana, Calif., said many of his clients seek out concrete because it's cheaper. "A fancy limestone fireplace will be tens of thousands of dollars," he said. "We make some really cool fireplaces that look like stone but cost $2,500." Including installation, fireplaces cost around $4,000. Moldings for doors and windows cost $10 to $12 per linear foot.
CEMENT CELLAR
At his Brooklyn studio, Chris Oricchio builds industrial-style decor such as barnwood pot racks ($200), concrete dining tables ($1,400) and travertine and mahogany coffee tables ($850). But wine bunkers, which cost $25 a unit, are his best sellers. Made of plaster and concrete cast into wood, the modular bunkers have rough, intentionally imperfect edges. "Concrete is like silly putty," said Mr. Oricchio, the 32-year-old owner of Decor Atelier. "It picks up the scarifications of whatever you cast it on, and that's what makes it beautiful."
HOB KNOBING
Grey Hensey, a 22-year-old design student at Auburn University and founder of Kast Concrete, has carved out a career niche with his concrete knobs ($8 each). He casts concrete into rubber molds, for a smooth, porcelainlike finish. "Everyone is using raw materials like metal, wood and concrete," Mr. Hensey said, "but by creating a glassy look, I'm trying to expand people's perceptions of what concrete can be. It doesn't have to look like a sidewalk, it can be delicate and refined."
LEFT HANGING
Kyle Bragg, a 28-year-old architect in Louisville, Ky., was inspired by the creative ways concrete was being used in large building projects and saw potential in its versatility. "It can be clean and modern with flat surfaces and hard corners," he said, "but it also has a wonderful rustic nature, with minor imperfections that make each piece unique." He launched FormdDesign in 2010 and sells his products at local stores around Louisville, but most of his business is online through Etsy, a site for artists and crafting. The wall hooks, his most popular item, are $27 for a set of three.

Full text:   Solar-panel maker Suntech Power Holdings Co. has been forced into Chinese bankruptcy proceedings, sparking questions about how U.S. investors will fare in the decline of one of China's most prominent companies.
Given Suntech's status as a major employer and a key player in an emerging industry -- it once was the world's largest supplier of solar panels -- Chinese authorities might be reluctant to let the company fold.
But if Suntech is liquidated, its Chinese creditors, who are owed more than $2 billion, likely would gain access to the company's assets before foreign bondholders would.
U.S. creditors were gearing up for a fight Wednesday. Suntech defaulted on a $541 million U.S. bond payment on Friday.
"If they take all the assets and give nothing to the U.S. investors, on the next deal, that's going to be remembered," said James Millar. The Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP partner represents four bondholders that had threatened to sue the company in the U.S. to collect on their investment after Suntech defaulted on the bond payment.
Mr. Millar said Wednesday that he and his clients were trying to determine if U.S. bondholders would get a seat in negotiations in China. Advisers for other bondholders declined to comment or couldn't be reached.
Suntech's bankruptcy also threatened to ripple beyond the company's stakeholders after corporate accounting scandals and a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy have rattled U.S. investors once enamored with China.
"Suntech was quite a highflier, and being able to list in the U.S. was a big deal," said Joseph Chan, a Shanghai-based partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. "Now the poster child is gone."
Himanshu Shah, president of Shah Capital Management, said his firm exited roughly a $4 million stake in Suntech in early January.
"There are always risks involved in investing anywhere, including China, so as an investor you have to do your due diligence better," said Mr. Shah. His firm has about $200 million in assets, including some Chinese companies, he said. "You really have to look at the shareholder and ownership structure." Most of Suntech's assets were pledged to Chinese lenders, which gave foreign lenders less leverage and protection, he said.
Mr. Shah said Suntech's bankruptcy could help healthy players in the industry capture a bigger share of the market. His firm has stakes in Suntech competitors Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., Trina Solar Ltd. and Canadian Solar Inc.
Suntech said Wednesday that eight Chinese banks on Monday filed an involuntary petition for insolvency and restructuring of the company's main operating subsidiary in China. The subsidiary, Wuxi Suntech, won't file an objection to the petition, Suntech said.
The Wuxi Municipal Intermediate People's Court in Jiangsu province will decide whether to accept the petition in the next few days, Suntech said. If the petition is approved, Suntech would continue to produce solar products to meet customer orders, the company said.
The Chinese banks are owed as much as 7.1 billion yuan ($1.14 billion) and include Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China Ltd., the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
The default on the $541 million U.S. bond triggered cross-defaults for Suntech's other outstanding debt, the company said.
Several Chinese companies in recent years have defaulted on bonds issued overseas, with mixed results for investors.
Suntech issued its bonds through a Cayman holding company in 2008, forcing creditors to go through court proceedings in that jurisdiction. Although 60% of Suntech bondholders have said they are willing to defer payment for two months, the remaining 40% still could try to force it to declare bankruptcy in the U.S. Such a filing would be the first of its kind in the U.S. for such a large Chinese company, but it wasn't clear that would be allowed under U.S. law.
"Investors need to know that when buying bonds from the Cayman holding company of a Chinese firm, they don't have recourse over the mainland assets," said Neil McDonald, a lawyer in Hong Kong at Hogan Lovells who specializes in corporate restructuring.
Wuxi-based Suntech remains one of the world's largest solar-panel manufacturers. But its earnings have declined because of a global oversupply of solar panels, a drop in prices and antidumping tariffs imposed on China by the U.S. that have weighed on the industry generally. The company said recently that it would end production at its plant in Arizona next month.
Suntech has been trying to find a white knight to take over and inject capital into the company. On Tuesday Suntech appointed two board members, one of whom is a former executive at Wuxi Goulian Development Corp., a state-backed investment firm.
The solar industry's debt deepened between 2009 and 2011 to fund expansion of manufacturing capacity. But while global solar-power demand has grown each year, it hasn't kept pace with manufacturing.
China had continued to support its solar companies, even as U.S. and European manufacturers had been forced into restructuring or bankruptcy. But China's State Council, the country's cabinet, in December signaled it would stop funding unprofitable domestic solar-panel makers and instead encourage mergers among healthy companies.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's new central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, begins work Thursday on a feat no one before has managed: reversing nearly two decades of falling prices to lift wages and profits in the world's third largest economy.
Mr. Kuroda's predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, is among those who say it can't be done, at least not with the tools at hand. Using central-bank policies to boost stagnant prices is like "punching air," Mr. Shirakawa told parliament on Friday.
But backed by recently elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the new central-bank governor has declared a mission to reach the bank's target of 2% inflation "as soon as humanly possible." Mr. Kuroda, 68 years old, is expected to begin buying trillions of yen more in bonds, along with other moves that echo strategies of the U.S. Federal Reserve and several other central banks.
The stakes for Japan -- and the world -- are high. Since 1998, Japan's consumer prices have dropped to 1992 levels. Wages are down 7%. Urban property prices are down 51%. Tax revenues are down 14%.
The Japanese economy has fallen to No. 3 from No. 2, behind the U.S. and China. An entire generation of Japanese have graduated from college, gotten jobs and, now approaching middle age, known only deflation.
Japan's weakness also has deprived the world economy of growth during the recessions and debt crises of the past decade. If the Bank of Japan experiment works, Japan could once again become an engine of global prosperity, as well as a more effective economic counterbalance to China.
Failure, however, could destabilize Japan's enormous government-bond market, and, by extension, its 2.2 quadrillion yen (about $23 trillion) financial system.
Even supporters of the new central-bank policies say Japan can't reverse course without significantly weakening the yen, an outcome that raises fears of a currency war. A weaker yen makes Japan's goods cheaper abroad, and the risk is that China and other nations might weaken their money in return.
Others aren't so worried. "Mr. Abe needs to do more and more. We're dying here!" said Masao Namiki, the 72-year-old president of a plastics mold maker in Tokyo. He hopes a weaker yen will revive firms, such as his, that have lost business to companies in China and other low-cost countries.
Mr. Namiki said he has just three shop workers, compared with 12 of them two decades ago. He shares machines with other mold makers rather than buy new equipment.
Japan's chronic deflation defies textbook solutions, and the debate has never been so heated. At one Tokyo shop, books on the topic battle for display space: "Reflation Is Dangerous," and "Deflation -- Explaining Japan's Chronic Sickness." Another is "America Knows That Japan's Economy Will Revive," by a Yale University economist and Abe adviser, Koichi Hamada, which asserts the BOJ has been out of step with modern global economic thought.
The shift to a more aggressive Bank of Japan could start as soon as Mr. Kuroda's first policy meeting in April, according to central-bank watchers. The BOJ could hold an emergency meeting even earlier.
Mr. Shirakawa, the departing central-bank governor, said the economy's problem is that Japan's population is shrinking, reducing demand for everything from cars to home mortgages. No matter how much cash the BOJ pumps into banks, the argument goes, money alone can't jump-start the economy because there aren't firms or consumers who want to borrow it.
That suggests the course followed by the Fed and other central banks to boost domestic economies -- low interest rates and so-called quantitative easing -- won't work in Japan. The BOJ already pushed interest rates to near zero in 1999, then followed with several rounds of government bond-buying that have nearly doubled the central bank's balance sheet to around 166 trillion yen from 91 trillion yen in 1998.
But Mr. Kuroda and Mr. Abe believe Japan suffers from deflation in part because consumers and businesses became accustomed to hoarding cash after the country's 1990s asset crash and lingering recession.
With few spending, demand falls, dragging down prices, profits and wages in a vicious cycle. They believe the solution is partly psychological -- persuading the Japanese to spend more today by convincing them prices are going up tomorrow.
"Mr. Kuroda has to sway the mind-set of the public," said Etsuro Honda, a former finance-ministry official and a chief adviser to Mr. Abe on BOJ strategy. "That's tough, changing people's psychology."
Mr. Kuroda has also said he favored buying longer-term bonds -- market watchers say 10- or even 30-year maturities -- which would in theory help drive down rates on longer-term bonds and business loans, encouraging investment.
So far, just talk of cranking up the BOJ cash machine, which started during Mr. Abe's campaign last fall, has made an impact. The yen has weakened 18% and stocks have risen more than 40% since mid-November on expectations of a change in central-bank policy.
The BOJ won't be tackling Japan's troubles alone. Mr. Abe has pledged 10.3 trillion yen in emergency government spending, as well as steps to boost long-term growth such as a bid announced Friday to join U.S.-led pan-Pacific free-trade negotiations.
Following a call by Mr. Abe for higher wages, such companies as Toyota Motor Corp. and convenience-store operator Lawson Inc. have announced bigger bonuses in the fiscal year that starts April 1.
One risk of the new policies -- dubbed Abenomics -- is that inflation, mostly through higher import costs, could push up prices for commodities and consumer goods well before an increase in profits and wages. That would turn into a drag on the economy rather than a push.
Energy prices, for example, went up 4% in the past year, and major utilities have said they are moving electricity prices up as much as 19% as nuclear power is increasingly displaced with imported fuel. Consumers say they are already paying more for everything from school lunches to swimming-pool fees.
In northern Iwate prefecture, Mikiya Yoshikawa, a manager at 48-car taxicab company Bunka Taxi, said most of the region's taxi firms are planning to raise fares about 9% in April, their first increase in 18 years, because rising fuel costs and fewer passengers mean they can no longer cover costs. Whether their price boosts spell better profits or lost business will depend on whether the broader economy picks up, said Mr. Yoshikawa.
"If the yen continues to weaken, inflation picks up, prices rise, then incomes rise -- that's all good. But there will certainly be a time lag" before the benefits get to consumers, Mr. Yoshikawa said. "If only prices rise but incomes don't, then people have no choice but to cut back on luxury items" like cab rides.
If inflation expectations push interest rates up before tax revenues have a chance to catch up, the government could find itself staggering under the interest payments on its quadrillion yen in debt.
Deflation has crippled the Japanese government's ability to corral its debt burden, already the worst among developed countries, at a huge 237% of gross domestic product and rising. Losing control over debt payments could undermine confidence in the Japanese bond market, scaring off investors and sparking a credit crisis bigger than Greece's.
"What I fear is that Japanese money might flee Japan," said Waseda University economist Yukio Noguchi, author of the hot-selling "Monetary Easing Will Bankrupt Japan."
A large portion of government bonds are held by Japan's banks, posing a threat if prices should plunge and yields soar. An October report from the International Monetary Fund estimated that a single percentage-point rise in interest rates would trigger paper losses on such holdings equal to 10% of key capital at major banks.
Japanese bond investors are skeptical. At Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., chief fixed-income fund manager Takehito Yoshino said he has been working in the industry since the early 1990s and can't remember a time when Japan had sustained inflation of 2% or more. He said he would continue to buy longer-term government bonds, since he doesn't expect consumer prices to rise much in the next few years. His only worry, he said, was central-bank purchases causing a bubble in the bond market that would eventually burst, crushing prices and spiking yields.
"They won't get a stable 2% rise in prices unless they create an asset bubble," similar to the one in Japan's highflying 1980s, said Mr. Yoshino.
In the far northern city of Sapporo, real-estate prices are finally rising, said Munekatsu Taguchi, an executive with Panda Real Estate, something he attributes partly to demand spurred by Japan's superlow interest rates. But he thinks higher demand will be limited to assets like stocks and real estate, doubting the bank will be successful in inducing an overall rise in prices. Home buyers, he added, are taking out floating-rate loans, a sign they expect rates to go lower.
Economists are divided over how best to navigate the various dangers. There is no precedent or proven formula to help Mr. Kuroda figure out how many trillions of yen the BOJ must produce to succeed. The more the central bank pumps out cash, the greater the impact on the yen, creating another path for rising prices and economic growth.
In one view, the weaker yen would make imports more expensive, pushing up prices. In Tokyo, Makoto Endo, secretary-general of the Wine Importers Association of Japan, said the weakening yen has already raised the cost of wine imports and left the association's 34 members resigned to raising prices when past inventory runs low in April or May.
A weaker yen also would boost profits for Japan's exporters by making goods cheaper abroad, eventually triggering higher wages and increased investment. Growing exports also would push up stock prices, encouraging people to put more of their money in the stock market instead of bank accounts.
Barclays economists estimate the Japanese currency has to depreciate roughly 30 yen against the dollar to reach the 2% inflation target in two years. Goldman Sachs estimates the dollar may have to rise to around 115 yen, from around 96 yen.
Japan has already been warned by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Gao Xiqing, president of China's sovereign-wealth fund, against depreciating the yen too fast.
Early calls from Mr. Abe and his deputies for a cheaper yen prompted the Group of 20 major nations last month to issue a statement that members wouldn't try to lower their country's exchange rates below the others'.
Japanese officials now say only that the yen might weaken as a result of the central bank's monetary easing. The worry outside Japan is that the weakening yen helps trigger similar actions abroad, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of investment giant Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco.
The debate is familiar ground for Mr. Kuroda, who spent most of his career on the front lines of Japan's battle to weaken the yen. He began as a disciple and then successor of Eisuke Sakakibara, the finance minister so well-known for talking down the currency that he was nicknamed Mr. Yen.
Mr. Kuroda's four-year tenure as Japan's currency czar was marked by 14 trillion yen in interventions to weaken the yen, as well as a running battle with the central bank, whose governor at the time privately favored a strong currency.
He continues to play to a tough audience. His former boss Mr. Sakakibara told investors Friday in Singapore that Japan's deflation couldn't be cured through monetary policy, and then joked that he was "worried about Mr. Kuroda."

Full text:   When Mark Bright attends wine events in China, he says, people often complain that California wine is overpriced and of poor quality.
The San Francisco-based winemaker and sommelier blames that reputation on vendors who have flooded China with cheap "plunk" wine that they sell at prices normally charged only for better vintages.
"It's horrible for California," says Mr. Bright, who laments that if this continues, "we're never going to be able to build a business in China."
California winemakers -- in particular those in Bay Area counties like Napa and Sonoma -- have spent decades establishing their wines as some of the best in the world. But in China, where drinking wine is a more recent phenomenon, these well-constructed wines compete with bulk wine from the state that is bottled, branded and sold at prices they could never command elsewhere.
California's wine establishment, led by Bay Area vintners, brokers and trade representatives, is now trying to change the image of the state's wine in China. Mr. Bright is working on a Mandarin-language book about California wines. The Wine Institute, a San Francisco-based advocacy group for California wines, in July 2011 started holding virtual tastings via video conference for Chinese journalists. And earlier this month, Gov. Jerry Brown announced plans to promote California wines on an upcoming trip to China.
There is a lot riding on the efforts. While China in 2012 accounted for just under $74 million of the $1.4 billion of U.S. wine exports -- about 90% of which comes from California -- that is up from $16 million in 2007 and $2.6 million in 2003, according to the Wine Institute.
"There's an amazing opportunity with this emerging middle class [in China] that's buying cars and watches and wine," says Linsey Gallagher, international marketing director for the Wine Institute. She adds that about 90% of the calls she gets these days are about China.
Some California wine businesses say they have seen firsthand how poor wines from the state have wound up in China. "We've had people just show up with bags of cash and say give me the cheapest wine. It was that bad," says Robert Dahl, chief executive of California Shiners, a Napa-based company that buys bulk wine and then blends it and bottles it for customers, who brand and sell it. The people, who are either from China or have business connections there, are often looking to make a quick buck, he says. He declined to name any of them.
Mr. Dahl started his company two years ago and says he is on track to ship one million cases of wine this year, almost all of it to China. He says that he takes steps to ensure that his is a high-quality product, including having the proper facilities to store and filter the wine.
"People were just sending junk," he says. "We've been pushing 100% against that. It makes us all look bad."
David Duckhorn, whose family once owned a Napa winery and who now lives in Shanghai, started a business importing wines to China in 2008 and has taken steps to distinguish the wine he sells from the lower-quality stuff. He says he only sells bottles that are branded the same as the ones a customer in the U.S. would get, from the same winemakers and sourced from the same vineyards.
Wine imported into China, like that brought to the U.S. from overseas, require a local-language label on the back. California winemakers would leave the back of their bottles blank or ship them with the Chinese-language labels already affixed. To demonstrate his wines are the real deal, Mr. Duckhorn now asks for winemakers he works with to ship bottles with an English-language label on the back and he sticks the Chinese import label over it.
"You can peel it off," he says, which lets buyers confirm the authenticity of the product.
Mr. Duckhorn's company, Via Pacifica U.S. Inc., will soon have eight offices in China, where his staff puts on tastings for Chinese buyers. He encourages them to check online the prices that the same bottles sell for in the U.S. so that they can tell whether it is overpriced.
A bottle of wine in China typically costs about two or three times what it would in the U.S. because of taxes, import fees and other costs.
Still, as a middleman Mr. Duckhorn can't always stop overpricing. One of his customers once bought some Decoy wine, a less-expensive release from the Duckhorn Winery -- formally owned by Mr. Duckhorn's family -- that retails in the U.S. for around $20 per bottle, and at a 10-times markup in China.
Ms. Gallagher of the Wine Institute says some of the current problems will go away as Chinese wine buyers become better educated. The institute has led trade missions to China with California winemakers to promote the wines and recently launched a Chinese-language website about California wines.
Ms. Gallagher says she has lately had some success marketing food-and-wine pairings, with California wines going well with spicy dishes and traditional Chinese food like barbecued meats. The Wine Institute has put on events with sommeliers and chefs to tout this in Beijing and Shanghai.
"Journalists [in China] now write about food-and-wine pairings and how good California wines are," she says.

Full text:   CHICAGO -- Hog prices fell to a 4 1/2-month low, pressured by sluggish demand for pork among U.S. consumers and importers such as China and Japan.
Lean hogs for April, the front-month contract, slipped 0.35 cent, or 0.4%, to 77.875 cents a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as traders speculated Wednesday that slowing pork exports will cause U.S. supplies to swell. The price was the lowest settlement since Nov. 6.
Hog prices have slumped nearly 12% since early February, due in part to U.S. consumers switching from pork to cheaper meats such as chicken.
Analysts point to economic pressures on consumers, including a rise in gasoline prices and the expiration in January of the payroll-tax holiday.
Prices also have fallen because traders had expected U.S. pork exports to be stronger this year. The volume of pork exported from the U.S. fell 15% in January from a year earlier, as China, Japan, Mexico and other big buyers of U.S. pork cut back, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation, a trade group.
The U.S. pork industry has become reliant on exports in recent years, reflecting in part China's growth in population and meat consumption. But while China, the world's biggest consumer of pork, was importing large amounts just 18 months ago, it has since built up its own hog supply and is relying less on U.S. supplies, analysts said. "They're not buying the pork, and we're ending up with plenty of pork here," said Art Liming, a futures specialist with Citigroup Inc. in Chicago.
Japan, typically the largest U.S. customer, has been importing less pork because of a struggling economy and weak currency, which has made it more expensive for its importers to buy U.S. pork. Russia, meanwhile, stopped importing U.S. pork in February, citing concerns about the medicated feed additive ractopamine, which is widely used in the U.S. to produce leaner meat.
Foreign importers bought 27% of the pork produced in 2012 in the U.S., up from just 7% in 2000, according to the Meat Export Federation.
U.S. pork production this year has fallen 2% from year-ago levels, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but that cut in supplies has been more than offset by lower exports, resulting in a rise in domestic pork inventories.
Typically, pork demand starts to pick up this time of year as the spring grilling season and the Easter holiday approach. But even as food retailers were stocking up on hams ahead of the March 31 Easter holiday in recent weeks, wholesale prices for ham declined, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures, said John Kleist, senior analyst with brokerage Ebottrading.com in Lakemoor, Ill.
Cold weather across much of the Midwest and East Coast has added to the pressure on the market, as consumers have no reason to buy meat for the warmer grilling season, Mr. Kleist said.

Full text:   Federal regulators are investigating Microsoft Corp.'s relationship with business partners that allegedly bribed foreign government officials in return for software contracts, according to people familiar with the matter.
Lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are examining kickback allegations made by a former Microsoft representative in China, as well as the company's relationship with certain resellers and consultants in Romania and Italy, these people said.
The investigation is in a preliminary phase, according to people familiar with the probe, and the government hasn't accused Microsoft or any of its business associates of wrongdoing. Such investigations can end with no charges being filed.
Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment.
"Like every large company with operations around the world we sometimes receive allegations about potential misconduct by employees or business partners," said John Frank, Microsoft's vice president and deputy general counsel. "We cooperate fully in any government inquiries," he added.
The probe is one of dozens being conducted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 law that prohibits U.S. companies and companies that trade on U.S. stock exchanges from paying bribes to foreign officials. Since 2009, the Justice Department has brought 108 cases while the SEC has brought 77, yielding a total of more than $2 billion in penalties, according to the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. The vast majority of FCPA cases settle.
The China allegations come from an anonymous tipster who passed them on to U.S. investigators in 2012, according to people familiar with the matter.
The allegations in China were also the subject of a 10-month internal investigation that Microsoft concluded in 2010, according to people briefed on the internal investigation.
The probe, conducted by an outside law firm, found no evidence of wrongdoing, these people said.
The tipster, who worked to land potential new business, alleged that an executive of Microsoft's China subsidiary instructed the tipster to offer kickbacks to Chinese officials in return for signing off on software contracts, according to people familiar with the matter and people briefed on the internal probe. The tipster, whose contract ended in 2008, was also involved in a labor dispute with Microsoft in China, they said.
Companies often spend millions of dollars investigating themselves for potential violations of anticorruption laws, then turn over the results to the government in the hope of getting lighter penalties or none at all.
U.S. government investigators are also reviewing whether Microsoft had a role in allegations that resellers offered bribes to secure software deals with Romania's Ministry of Communications, according to people familiar with the matter.
A ministry spokeswoman said the allegations were inconsistent with agency records and that ministry officials aren't privy to the business arrangements between Microsoft and its intermediaries.
The agencies are looking at Microsoft's dealings with consultants in Italy that specialize in customer-loyalty programs, the people familiar with the matter said. They have received allegations that Microsoft's Italian unit used such consultants as vehicles for lavishing gifts and trips on Italian procurement officials in exchange for government business, the person said.
Microsoft said more than 170 of its employees are responsible for investigating or monitoring compliance with company policies, including those related to FCPA.
"We take all allegations seriously and investigate them fully regardless of the source," said Mr. Frank of Microsoft. "We also invest heavily in proactive training, monitoring and audits to ensure our business operations around the world meet the highest legal and ethical standards."
Following the publication Tuesday of The Wall Street Journal's article about the bribery investigation, Mr. Frank wrote on a Microsoft blog: "The matters raised in the Wall Street Journal are important, and it is appropriate that both Microsoft and the government review them. It is also important to remember that it is not unusual for such reviews to find that an allegation was without merit."
A new whistleblower program at the SEC, established in the summer of 2010 with the passage of Dodd-Frank, has added fuel to the government's FCPA enforcement efforts.
The program provides cash incentives for employees to blow the whistle on securities violations, including breaches of the FCPA. If the SEC gets involved and finds wrongdoing after a whistleblower complaint, a tipster stands to gain as much as 30% of any monetary sanction the agency recovers. The agency's whistleblower office, which often works in conjunction with the Justice Department, reported receiving 115 tips alleging violations of the FCPA in the fiscal year that ended in September 2012.
Microsoft has offices in more than 100 countries, and the company disclosed it had about 94,000 full-time employees as of June 30. The company said in 2012 there were roughly 640,000 Microsoft partner businesses world-wide.
Overseas, as in the U.S., the company's largest chunk of sales are for software such as the Windows system that is the backbone of most computers in use at workplaces and government offices, and Microsoft Office, the bundle of software that includes Word for creating documents, Excel for spreadsheets and Outlook for email.

Full text:   BEIJING -- In a symbolic but significant meeting, new Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew acknowledged they wouldn't be able to settle all diplomatic differences but said the nations should continue to seek progress where possible.
The meeting was the first for Mr. Xi in his new role as president, as well as Mr. Lew's first meeting with a foreign leader as Treasury secretary.
Mr. Lew prodded China on familiar issues, such as reducing trade barriers to U.S. investment. A U.S. official said after the meeting that Mr. Lew raised issues about the exchange rate, cybersecurity, intellectual property and North Korea. They also discussed the global economy and the situation in Cyprus, the official said.
Mr. Xi told Mr. Lew the countries would "unavoidably" continue to have differences but said they could be minimized if Washington approaches the relationship in a "strategic and long-term" way.
The meeting serves as a test for Mr. Lew, known for his budgetary skills, but less so for his foreign-policy expertise. He dined with Finance Minister Lou Jiwei. and will meet Wednesday with Premier Li Keqiang and central-bank Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan.

Full text:   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -- In this violence-plagued border town where thousands of workers assemble U.S.-bound goods, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is betting that it can piece together an investment that was undercut by the U.S. recession and drug wars.
In December, Brookfield completed its purchase of an 81% stake in Verde Realty, a large property owner on the Mexico border, in a deal that valued Verde at $886 million. Brookfield declined to disclose how much it paid for the stake. Verde was founded a decade ago by real-estate mogul William Sanders largely on the belief that manufacturing along the border -- fueled by the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement -- would gather steam.
But, with property values depressed on the Mexican side of the border, Verde turned into a financial disaster for the long list of high-powered investors that Mr. Sanders led into the company, including Vornado Realty Trust and Fortress Investment Group. Between 2003 and 2007, Mr. Sanders financed the company by selling shares for $25 to $33 each. The price paid by Brookfield and its partner, Ross Perot Jr.'s Hillwood Development Co., to buy the company: $13.85 a share.
Real-estate experts say that the value of industrial property has declined by as much as 10% in some Mexican border cities. "There was a discount for Mexican assets," said David Arthur, managing partner of Toronto-based Brookfield, which has $181 billion in assets under management, including real estate, infrastructure and energy.
Brookfield's bet also is based on its belief that a recovery is under way. Mr. Arthur points to a decline in drug violence and a strengthening of U.S.-Mexico trade. Hubs such as Juarez have been particularly important for assembling goods such as flat-screen televisions and all-terrain vehicles. Verde owns 18 million square feet of industrial property, one-third of it on the Mexican side of the border.
But these days, investing in Mexico is a contrarian bet. There are "a limited number of people who have an interest in Mexico" in the current real-estate climate, Verde Chief Executive Ron Blankenship explained to investors on a conference call last year about the Brookfield deal. "I realize there is frustration about this point, but that is the position we're in."
Mexican border factories, known as maquiladoras, sprouted in the 1960s, but their growth accelerated after Nafta made most trade between the U.S. and Mexico duty-free. Currently, nearly 1.5 million workers are employed in one or more of 2,800 maquiladoras in Mexico, according to John Christman, a retired analyst in Mexico City who tracks the industry. In Juarez, industrial space has grown to 60 million square feet from 29 million in 1997, according to CBRE Group Inc.
Yet, amid that growth there have been fits and starts. Maquiladoras stagnated and, in some cases, contracted in the early 2000s because of the U.S. recession then and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Low-skill manufacturing, namely apparel, has migrated to countries such as China, Honduras and the Dominican Republic.
More recently, the strength of maquiladoras has been sapped by the global economic downturn and the drug war. The industrial vacancy rate in Mexico's border towns stands at 8.6%, nearly twice Mexico's national average, according to brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle.
On a recent visit to Juarez, there was ample evidence of the damage done by the drug war and poverty to the maquiladora dream. Outside the factories, some federal police patrolled the streets in vehicles bristling with high-caliber guns. Residents live in rows of tightly packed, dilapidated homes, and windblown garbage clutters the streets and open fields. The factories themselves have high perimeter fences, gatehouses and numerous security cameras. Workers at Verde facilities that were toured rarely venture outside during their shifts and eat in no-frills cafeterias.
Juarez has a 15% vacancy rate partly because of the recession and its reputation as the bloodiest venue for drug-cartel violence. According to the government in Juarez's home state of Chihuahua, homicides in Juarez declined to 730 last year from 3,084 in 2010.
Maquiladoras in Juarez screen prospective employees for criminal records and keep little cash on their premises. Many plants got rid of their ATMs in 2008 after a rash of robberies in which thieves stole machines and forced employees at gunpoint to give their security codes, according to accounts in the Mexican press.
In an interview, Mr. Blankenship said the weak economy was more to blame for Juarez's high vacancy than violence. "I'm not minimizing the violence, but I can think of only one tenant that we lost due to that."
Other large owners of Mexican border warehouses include U.S. real-estate investment trust Prologis Inc., Prudential Real Estate Investors and a joint venture of Kimco Realty Corp. and a Mexican firm. In December, a Mexican REIT created by Australian banking giant Macquarie Group debuted on the Mexican Stock Exchange and quickly amassed a portfolio of 224 industrial properties, most of them in Mexican border cities, in two deals totaling $1.5 billion.
Brookfield is counting on tenants such as manufacturer Viasystems Group Inc., which makes, among other things, energy-converter equipment to be installed in wind turbines. Homero Galindo, general manager of the 200,000-square-foot plant, noted that the clean, professional atmosphere in Juarez's industrial buildings differs from the city's gritty streets. "The violence pits the cartels one against the other," he said. "But the people who go to work every morning are very good."

GLOBAL HEALTH
Nations Need $1.6 Billion
For TB Fight, Groups Say
Global health authorities said they need an extra $1.6 billion a year at minimum to fight tuberculosis in poor countries -- a large chunk of it to prevent and treat drug-resistant strains of the ancient, airborne disease.
The projection, from the World Health Organization and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, underscores the deepening epidemic of drug-resistant TB, the high cost of identifying and treating those complex and difficult cases, and the lack of health funding currently going toward it.
To identify all new cases of TB and step up treatment of drug-resistant strains over the next several years, the 118 low- and middle-income countries that qualify for international aid from the Global Fund need a total of $4.8 billion a year, the two health organizations said. That would allow treatment for 17 million people with all forms of TB, and save six million lives in 2014 to 2016, they estimated. The 118 countries can provide $3.2 billion of that annually themselves.

Shale-Gas Boom Alone Won't Propel U.S. Industry

Abstract: Despite the benefits of lower energy costs, however, the game hasn't changed dramatically for most American manufacturers. Because of plentiful domestic supplies, natural-gas prices are likely to average $4 to $5 per 1,000 cubic feet over the next two decades, far below those in Europe, where they reached $10 to $13 recently, or northeastern Asia, where they have been $15 to $20, says Robert Ineson, who heads North American natural-gas research at IHS Global. The deficit in trade of manufacturing goods widened to about $687 billion last year from $673 billion in 2011, according to Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity & Innovation, a research group in Arlington, Va. Since the start of 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment has edged up 4.5%, to nearly 12 million, but remains far below the more than 17 million employed in 2000.

Full text:   Cheap energy flowing from the U.S. shale-gas boom is often touted as a "game changer" for manufacturing. Despite the benefits of lower energy costs, however, the game hasn't changed dramatically for most American manufacturers.
Because of plentiful domestic supplies, natural-gas prices are likely to average $4 to $5 per 1,000 cubic feet over the next two decades, far below those in Europe, where they reached $10 to $13 recently, or northeastern Asia, where they have been $15 to $20, says Robert Ineson, who heads North American natural-gas research at IHS Global.
This energy-cost advantage is "a huge tailwind" for the U.S. economy, says John Faraci, chief executive of International Paper Co., a Memphis-based paper-and-packing maker.
Still, the price of natural gas is only one factor manufacturers consider when deciding where to locate plants. Taxes, labor costs and skills, regulation and government incentives also figure into the mix. Perhaps the biggest factor is long-term demand for goods. The biggest growth in demand is still expected to be in China, India and other emerging markets. Global companies typically want to locate production near their biggest customers.
International Paper's strategy illustrates the thinking of many global companies. The company spends roughly $1 billion a year on energy for 32 mills around the world, or about 10% of its total manufacturing costs. As a heavy energy user, International Paper expects benefits from lower gas prices, largely because cheaper energy should stimulate the entire U.S. economy, increasing demand for packaging.
But International Paper's competitors for American sales mostly also produce in the U.S. and will get the same energy-cost advantage. International Paper is putting most of its capital investment in such overseas markets as Russia, China, India and Brazil; it doesn't plan any new plants in the U.S., where demand for paper has been shrinking and packaging sales are growing only modestly.
"Our investments are really driven by demand, not costs," says Mr. Faraci, the CEO.
The story is similar at JM Eagle, a Los Angeles maker of plastic pipes with annual sales exceeding $1 billion. JM Eagle is getting a modest sales boost because some of its products are used in producing shale gas. In addition, gas is a feedstock for the resins JM Eagle buys as raw materials, so the company might be expected to benefit from low gas prices.
But Walter Wang, owner and chief executive of JM Eagle, says raw-material costs haven't fallen and probably won't. Instead, he says, resin producers are benefiting from higher margins while keeping prices steady. "They will find a way to keep the price stable because they can always export" if the domestic market is glutted, Mr. Wang says.
Though JM Eagle has always focused mainly on the North American market, it recently built its first plant in China and eventually will need at least 10 plants there, Mr. Wang says. He is investing more money in China than in the U.S. because the Chinese market has better long-term growth prospects.
For some companies, low gas prices are indeed changing the game. That includes makers of petrochemicals (whose raw materials include natural gas) and producers of materials or equipment used in energy production and exploration.
U.S. Steel Corp. has benefited from rising sales of pipes used in shale-gas production and distribution. Over the past two years, the company has upgraded its capacity for the kind of finishing work needed to make pipes rugged enough to be drilled thousands of feet into the earth; those investments include a new $100 million facility at its Lorain, Ohio, plant.
The shale-gas boom should help hold down electricity costs in the U.S. and may lower transportation costs too, helping the entire economy. BNSF Railway Co. recently said it plans to test using natural gas rather than diesel fuel to power locomotives. FedEx Corp. said it is likely to use natural gas for many trucks within the next decade, which in turn should spur investment in new types of engines.
So far, however, trade figures don't show an overall improvement in U.S. competitiveness: The deficit in trade of manufacturing goods widened to about $687 billion last year from $673 billion in 2011, according to Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity & Innovation, a research group in Arlington, Va. Since the start of 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment has edged up 4.5%, to nearly 12 million, but remains far below the more than 17 million employed in 2000.
Economists say the outlook for U.S. manufacturing has improved for several reasons. As wages in China rise swiftly, the labor-cost advantages of manufacturing there are diminishing. Meanwhile, U.S. companies have become warier of losing control of intellectual property in overseas plants and of relying on long supply lines overseas that can be disrupted by earthquakes or other natural disasters.
Now the gas boom is adding another reason for manufacturers to consider making things in America, at least to supply the North American market, says Dave Sievers, a principal at Hackett Group, a Miami-based consulting firm that advises manufacturers. But "it's not going to turn everything upside down," Mr. Sievers says. "It's not like the U.S. is going to be the workshop for the world."

Abstract: General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC once had a stranglehold on the U.S. market but have lost market share over the years to foreign competitors, including Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Co. Meanwhile, the market in Japan is dominated by its domestic auto makers, which U.S. companies blame on Japanese trade barriers.

Full text:   Japan's move Friday to join talks on a trans-Pacific free-trade pact raises the stakes for U.S.-led efforts to expand trade and is sure to kick off a long battle involving industries, including autos and agriculture, that have long benefited from tariffs and other barriers imposed by their home countries.
A successful trade pact would alter advantages those industries enjoy in the U.S. and Japan, the world's No. 1 and No. 3 economies, respectively.
The Obama administration's top trade official, acting Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis, welcomed the move -- a bold bid by Japan to lift its flagging economy -- and said the two countries have been involved in preliminary discussions for a year. But he indicated Japan would have to make concessions.
"While we continue to make progress in these consultations, important work remains to be done," Mr. Marantis said.
The stakes are particularly high for each nation's auto makers. General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC once had a stranglehold on the U.S. market but have lost market share over the years to foreign competitors, including Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Co. Meanwhile, the market in Japan is dominated by its domestic auto makers, which U.S. companies blame on Japanese trade barriers.
Fifty members of Congress, almost all Democrats, asked the White House to take a tough line on Japan in considering whether to approve its entry into the talks. In a Thursday letter, the lawmakers singled out the fact Japan has the smallest share of auto imports among developed economies. About 6% of Japan's car sales are imports, while more than 40% of cars sold in the U.S. are imports, the letter stated.
"We've been trying for decades to essentially say to the Japanese that this has to be two-way trade," said Rep. Sandy Levin (D., Mich.), who led the drafting of the letter. "Nothing's worked."
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks, known as TPP, is a "last chance" to take part in a rule-making process that could shift global trade. "For Japan to remain inward-looking means we are giving up on the possibility of growth," Mr. Abe said in Tokyo.
The move is part of a multipronged effort by Mr. Abe to lift Japan from a decadeslong economic malaise that also includes government stimulus spending and monetary easing by Japan's central bank.
Japan must win approval from the 11 nations involved in the Pacific trade talks, which isn't guaranteed. The country's bid to join the talks comes a month after the U.S. and European Union agreed to pursue their own sweeping trade pact.
The move also heightens pressure on the world's No. 2 economy, China, which isn't involved in the trade talks, to eventually alter trading practices other countries say have given Chinese manufacturers an unfair advantage in the global marketplace. "What I think it does do is say to China that higher-standard rules are increasingly going to be the standard in that region," said Edward Gerwin, a trade analyst at Third Way, a Washington think tank.
Friday's announcement comes after weeks of tension within Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, a pro-business conservative party with strong ties to farm associations that have significant influence over the rural vote.

Full text:   Chinese manufacturers of vitamin C offered an unusual legal defense for why they shouldn't be found liable for price fixing in a recent civil trial: Their government made them do it.
A federal jury in Brooklyn didn't buy it.
On Thursday, after less than a day of deliberations, it found Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co. and affiliated company North China Pharmaceutical Group Corp. liable for fixing prices on vitamin C for several years.
It was the first time Chinese companies had been on trial in the U.S. for alleged antitrust violations, according to Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP's William Isaacson, who represented U.S. vitamin C buyers that brought the price-fixing allegations.
The judge in the case ordered the companies to pay $162 million in damages, triple what the jury had awarded. Antitrust violations like price-fixing are subject to treble damages.
"This verdict shows that companies in China are going to have to play by the same rules as everybody else," Mr. Isaacson said.
The vitamin C makers generally didn't dispute that they acted together to set prices. Instead, during the trial which lasted over two weeks, they argued that their government forced them to coordinate pricing and output.
China's Ministry of Commerce filed legal papers that supported the companies' position and urged that the case be thrown out, saying it couldn't be resolved without interfering with Chinese industrial policies.
The ministry also expressed concern that the U.S. court didn't properly defer to China's interpretation of its own domestic laws. Other companies facing similar allegations had settled the case before the verdict.
Lawyers who represented the defendants and the Ministry of Commerce didn't respond to requests for comment on Thursday. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment.
The case was brought by plaintiffs including a Texas animal feed company and a New Jersey vitamin distributor.
They alleged the Chinese vitamin C makers voluntarily formed an illegal price fixing cartel, one that increased prices significantly and imposed tens of millions of dollars in damages on U.S. consumers since late 2001.
The Chinese companies sold raw vitamins that were then used in the U.S. as an ingredient in food and beverage products, consumer vitamins and animal products, the plaintiffs said.
Attempts to blame the price-fixing on directives from the Chinese government ran counter to China's declarations to U.S. government agencies and the World Trade Organization that it doesn't compel price-fixing for any exported product, the plaintiffs argued.
The trial included testimony from Qiao Haili, a now-retired official from Beijing who worked at the China Chamber of Commerce of Medicines & Health Products Importers & Exporters.
Mr. Qiao, with a court-appointed interpreter huddled next to him in the witness box, testified that the Ministry of Commerce assigned him to the chamber, where he had authority over the companies' vitamin C production and export pricing.
"With respect to vitamin C, I had controlling means," Mr. Qiao said. "The government supported me toward the vitamin C."
The vitamin C makers said they had to follow directives issued by Mr. Qiao, while the challengers said Mr. Qiao wasn't a government official and the Chamber of Commerce where he worked wasn't a governmental organization.
Judge Brian Cogan ruled previously that Chinese law didn't compel the companies' conduct. He also declined to dismiss the case on grounds of enhancing relations between the U.S. and China.
Jeffrey Jacobovitz, an antitrust litigator with Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, said the companies' legal defense was "highly unusual, particularly when it involves the Chinese government."
Going forward, multinational Chinese companies "are going to have to carefully balance their responsibilities as global businesses with their obligations to and relationships with the Chinese state, recognizing that serious consequences may flow from tilting the scale too far in either direction," said John Terzaken, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer now with law firm Allen & Overy.
Thursday's jury verdict comes more than a decade after similar price-fixing allegations were made against other foreign producers of vitamins.
In one of the largest-ever white-collar crime investigations, Swiss, Japanese and German companies were found to have conspired to raise vitamin prices in the late 1990s.
They were prosecuted in both the U.S. and Europe, paying $1 billion in criminal fines and more than $1 billion in civil judgments.
European and Japanese companies later exited the market, under pressure from Chinese companies that enjoyed lower production costs than their foreign competitors.
According to court documents, the U.S. market for vitamin C exceeds $100 million annually.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama in a congratulatory phone call to new Chinese President Xi Jinping raised the issue of cybersecurity, a strong sign of increasing focus on the issue in relations between the two countries.
In addition to discussing U.S. concerns about the North Korean nuclear threat, the White House said, Mr. Obama "highlighted the importance of addressing cybersecurity threats," which he cast as a "shared challenge." Mr. Obama framed cybersecurity in an economic context as the two countries address issues of trade, investment, and intellectual-property protections.
The White House didn't characterize Mr. Xi's response. China's state-run Xinhua news agency said Messrs. Xi and Obama exchanged views on the situation of the Korean peninsula and cybersecurity among other issues, and that Mr. Xi "expressed China's principles and positions on those issues."
Mr. Obama's comments to Mr. Xi follow demands this week by his national-security adviser, Thomas Donilon, that China cease its backing of hacking to steal intellectual property from U.S. companies and that it work with other countries to develop common rules of behavior in cyberspace.
Chinese officials deny that Beijing engaged in such activities. On Saturday, China's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi called for cooperation on cybersecurity and said that China is a victim of cyberattacks. "Cyberspace needs not war, but rules and cooperation," he said.
Mr. Xi was confirmed as state president Thursday at an annual meeting of China's National People's Congress.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The nation's top spies warned Tuesday of the rising threat of cyberattacks to national and economic security, comparing the concern more directly than before to the dangers posed by global terrorism.
U.S. intelligence officials told a Senate hearing that the nation is vulnerable to cyberespionage, cybercrime and outright destruction of computer networks, both from sophisticated, government-sponsored assault as well as criminal hacker groups and cyberterrorists.
"It's hard to overemphasize its significance," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, addressing members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "These capabilities put all sectors of our country at risk -- from government and private networks to critical infrastructures."
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller cited cybersecurity as something that keeps him awake at night, saying at the hearing it "has grown to be right up there" with terrorism.
The intelligence officials, in describing an annual inventory of global problems, didn't reveal imminent new cyberthreats or previously undisclosed plots.
But they amplified their warnings by casting them in terms usually reserved for threats emanating from al Qaeda and Iran, and they included projections of where the danger is expected to lead in the next two years.
The warnings came as part of an aggressive Obama administration campaign to draw attention to cybersecurity and to stir action to counter infiltrations and attacks that officials have said could allow foes to commandeer a nuclear-power plant or disrupt the financial system.
Last month, President Barack Obama signed an executive order aimed at bolstering computer-network protections, and he noted the "rapidly growing threat from cyberattacks" in his State of the Union address.
"We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy," he said then.
The following week, the administration rolled out a strategy to combat the theft of trade secrets. And Monday, in a speech in New York, National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon singled out China as a top perpetrator, demanding it adopt international standards of behavior in cyberspace.
Chinese officials deny that Beijing engaged in such activities.
On Saturday, China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, called for cooperation on cybersecurity and said that China is a victim of cyberattacks. "Cyberspace needs not war, but rules and cooperation," Mr. Yang said at a news conference. He said cyberspace shouldn't become a "new battlefield."
Mr. Obama discussed the issue with lawmakers when he met behind closed doors Tuesday with a group of Senate Democrats, participants in the meeting said. The administration push continues Wednesday when Mr. Obama holds a meeting with U.S. executives in the White House Situation Room to discuss cybersecurity.
But for all the collective worrying, there was little agreement between the Obama administration and Congress Tuesday over how to address the problem.
At a second Senate hearing, before the Armed Services Committee, lawmakers tussled over the role of the federal government in guarding against threats.
Army Gen. Keith Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command, a part of the military, acknowledged that the Obama administration is debating internally how to proceed when U.S. companies are under cyberattack.
"The issue that we're weighing is: When does a nuisance become a real problem and when are you prepared to step in for that?" he said at the hearing. "That's the work that I think the administration is going through right now and highlighting that."
Lawmakers, too, acknowledged they can't agree on legislative measures to bolster protections for computer networks.
Last year, Republicans defeated a White House-backed bill that would have established voluntary cybersecurity standards for companies running critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid, citing concerns about a government role in cybersecurity.
Mr. Obama's executive order last month established voluntary standards as an interim measure, but the order lacks key incentives for companies to participate, like liability protections, that would require legislation.
The cost of protections remains another stumbling block, particularly for power companies, Gen. Alexander said, as he provided a relative ranking of computer protections in private industry.
"The banks and the Internet-service companies are pretty good; the power companies, not so good," Gen. Alexander said.
In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in February, Kenneth W. DeFontes Jr., chief executive of Baltimore Gas & Electric Co., told lawmakers that the electric industry takes cybersecurity "very seriously."
Intelligence officials cited cyberassaults last year on the websites of many U.S. banks and a more destructive attack on a Saudi oil company that destroyed 30,000 computers as examples of the kind of disruptions already taking place.
They didn't discuss who mounted those attacks, but U.S. defense and intelligence officials have said the Iranian government is behind them. Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks.
"What we're seeing with the banks today I am concerned is going to grow significantly throughout the year," Gen. Alexander said at the hearing.
Looking ahead, Mr. Clapper said that chances of an ultrasophisticated attack capable of wiping out major nationwide computer networks are "remote." Countries most capable of carrying out such an attack -- China and Russia -- are unlikely to launch such assaults in the absence of a conflict or crisis, according to the assessment.
But even relatively unsophisticated hackers were projected by the intelligence officials of eventually being capable of disrupting insecure computer networks running parts of vital functions -- like the power grid.

Abstract: Property sales have soared 77.6% from last year's levels in value terms over the first two months of 2013, while credit has also expanded rapidly. Because China's leaders repeatedly have said one of their top priorities is to keep a property bubble from reinflating, a continuation of these trends would put pressure on the central bank to clamp down.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China's economy showed signs of weakness in the first two months of the year, falling short of expectations it would resume the kind of strong growth with low inflation that has helped drive a global economic recovery.
Statistics released over the past few days paint a picture of a China where inflation is mounting and domestic economic activity is slowing. Lending and property construction remain strong, but if the central bank senses that a credit-backed property surge is in the offing it could feel pressed to pinch credit, which could impede growth.
The disappointing recent numbers leave analysts divided about China's growth prospects. "The weak activity data and rising inflation reinforce our view that China's potential growth has dropped to 7% to 7.5%, if not lower," wrote Nomura analyst Zhiwei Zhang, who is more bearish than most bank economists who follow China. For 2013, he forecasts China's GDP will grow 7.7%.
Louis Kuijs, China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, who is on the optimistic end, also said the statistics had given him cause to rethink how well China's economy will perform. Since the end of 2012, "the data has been a little on the weaker side than you would have expected." But he says he hasn't changed his forecast that China will grow 8.4% in 2013.
It is hard to judge any economy by two months of data, especially when making adjustments for the Lunar New Year holiday, which was celebrated in January in 2012 and February in 2013. But with the world economy still in a fragile state, the strength of China's economy, the world's second largest after the U.S., takes on even greater importance.
China's departing premier, Wen Jiabao, last week said China was retaining its 7.5% growth target for the year. That number isn't considered a forecast, but a signal to provinces that the central government is convinced that the years of double-digit growth are over. China routinely exceeds its GDP target; GDP grew 7.8% in 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, China reported that economic output rose 7.9% compared with the year-earlier period, halting seven consecutive quarters of declining growth. The acceleration from the third quarter, when GDP increased 7.4% year-to-year, eased concerns that China was in the midst of a downward spiral.
But since then, the economic news has been less rosy. On Saturday, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported consumer inflation jumped to 3.2% year-to-year in February, up from 2% in January, for the highest increase since April last year, though prices were likely boosted by the Lunar New Year, which often sees a spike in food prices and other goods.
Property sales have soared 77.6% from last year's levels in value terms over the first two months of 2013, while credit has also expanded rapidly. Because China's leaders repeatedly have said one of their top priorities is to keep a property bubble from reinflating, a continuation of these trends would put pressure on the central bank to clamp down. Already, a sharp climb in property prices prompted the government to pledge earlier this month to strictly enforce a 20% profit tax on property sales as a means of holding down speculative activity.
On a number of fronts, economic activity slowed early in the year. Industrial production grew slightly more slowly, with a 9.9% year-to-year rise in January and February, after a 10.3% gain in December. The government releases combined figures for the first two months of the year to avoid distortions related to the timing of the Lunar New Year.
Retail-sales growth slowed to 12.3% year-to-year in the first two months of the year, compared with a 15.2% gain in December. Nomura said that was the slowest growth in the January-February period since 2004.
The government's anticorruption effort may be taking a bite out of the luxury end of the retail market, a number of analysts said. Chinese leaders, most prominently new Communist Party Chief Xi Jinping, have been calling for an end to officials' expenditures on luxury.
Imports fell 15.2% in February, the government reported Friday, compared with the year-earlier period, another sign suggesting a slowdown in domestic demand, though the steepness of the trade could reflect the timing of the New Year. For the first two months of the year, imports were up a modest 5%, compared with a 6% gain in December.
Exports were a positive surprise, rising 21.8% in February, compared with the year earlier. For the January-February period, the gain was 23.6% year-to-year, compared with a December year-to-year increase of 14%. While some analysts said that presaged a strengthening of the global demand, others were more skeptical, saying the gains were out of line with more modest export gains in Taiwan and South Korea.
"We cannot conclude if this reflects genuine economic strength," said Nomura's Mr. Zhang. Mr. Kuijs of RBS said miscounting of exports could reduce the percentage gains by four or five percentage points.

Abstract: While its tropical beaches, cloud forests and proximity to the U.S. are selling points to millions of tourists, Costa Rica's location has also attracted traffickers hauling cocaine from Andean nations northward. Ms. Chinchilla, who took office in May 2010, is one of a growing number of regional leaders who have called for debate on the legalization of drugs to help curb demand and reduce violence.

Full text:   PENAS BLANCAS, Costa Rica -- Mexican and Colombian cartels have already turned parts of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador into a major drug-trafficking corridor, while driving up homicide rates. They are now pulling in Costa Rica, Central America's standout economy and democracy.
While its tropical beaches, cloud forests and proximity to the U.S. are selling points to millions of tourists, Costa Rica's location has also attracted traffickers hauling cocaine from Andean nations northward.
"Our geography has us prisoner," said President Laura Chinchilla, in an interview.
The U.S. State Department said in an annual narcotics report released last week that Costa Rica is facing drug violence and crime due to its "inadequate resources and complicated bureaucracy." It said Costa Rica should enact laws that target criminal groups.
Costa Rican antidrug police seized 15.5 tons of cocaine last year -- worth more than $2 billion on the U.S. street -- more than double the amount the year before, the Public Security Ministry said recently.
About a fifth of those seizures happened at this bustling border crossing with Nicaragua. Penas Blancas's ramshackle police station, a front line in fighting Costa Rica's cross-border drugs trade, underscores the country's uphill battle.
There are three checkpoints here, two for a long line of trucks that stretch for miles in both directions, and one for people crossing the border on foot. Drivers sling hammocks underneath truck beds to snooze during the some half-day waits to cross the border.
The checkpoint for thousands of people who cross the border on foot each day is a rickety wooden rain shelter manned by a sole police officer at a picnic table.
"It is very rustic. It is old," said an antidrug police official. "It makes [their work] more difficult. There isn't enough good equipment."
Shifting patterns in the drugs trade in the 1990s and 2000s due to the weakening of Colombian cartels and Mexico's war on its own cartels are prompting drug gangs to step up their activity in Central America, an isthmus of mostly small and weak governments.
Antidrug seizures peaked in the late-2000s, as Costa Rican authorities captured large hauls of cocaine from boats off the Pacific Coast. Public Security Minister Mario Zamora said that crackdown prompted cartels to seek other routes and ways in which they more frequently evade detection.
"The technique was to carry large quantities [of cocaine]. Now they use small amounts," he said in an interview. Cartels "take other routes where they are fewer police. They are always studying to find the alternative route."
Still, more than 80% of the South American cocaine trafficked to the U.S. -- the world's biggest cocaine consumer -- was moved through Central America, according to the State Department's report last week. That is a change from the 1980s, when most cocaine was shipped through the Caribbean.
The White House included Costa Rica on its list of major illicit drug transit or producing countries in its most recent report on the subject. It was the third time this tiny nation earned that distinction, which included 22 nations, most of them in the Americas.
Ms. Chinchilla, who took office in May 2010, is one of a growing number of regional leaders who have called for debate on the legalization of drugs to help curb demand and reduce violence.
U.S. officials have so far rejected those calls.
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala are bearing the brunt of the assault by narcotraffickers. Overall, the U.N. says Central America is the world's most violent noncombat zone. Honduras, for instance, has a per-capita homicide rate of 92, compared with about five per 100,000 residents in the U.S.
But now, Costa Rica a relatively peaceful and prosperous country compared with its neighbors, is under assault. It is a major concern for a government that prides itself on its high marks for literacy and health care. Costa Rica abolished its military in 1948 and its citizens enjoy the benefits of heavy social spending.
But it is hard-pressed to match the power and stealth of drug cartels including Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, which Costa Rican law-enforcement officials say is the biggest threat.
"It is easier to smuggle up through Central America than try to get it directly into the U.S." by airplane or boat, said a senior U.S. law-enforcement official. "They can also avoid detection or being investigated by U.S. law enforcement."
Along with the increased flow of drugs has come a rise in homicides: between 2005 and 2010, homicides in Costa Rica rose 71% to 518. The killings have declined slightly over the last two years, with 394 murders in 2012.
To help fight violent crime, Costa Rica last year boosted its police budget by 11% from 2011 to $351.5 million -- slightly less than the police budget of Baltimore -- to fight drug-related and common crime.
Since 2009, Central America has received nearly $500 million from the U.S. under a security initiative to fight drug traffickers.
But Costa Rica is looking elsewhere for more aid, and recently received a $20 million from China for Costa Rica's new police school, Mr. Zamora said.
Some say the country is by far the best prepared in the region to deal with the problem, but it must act fast.

Full text:   UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. Security Council imposed its fourth and most stringent set of sanctions on North Korea in response to its latest nuclear-weapons test, a vote preceded by heightened Korean threats of an attack against the U.S.
The new measures, adopted unanimously by the 15-member council, require nations to crack down on North Korean financial transactions and check cargo suspected of containing nuclear and missile-related contraband, among other actions that before were only voluntary.
The resolution, aimed at forcing North Korea to abandon its nuclear-weapons program, calls for Pyongyang to return to the table for international negotiations. It also threatens harsher sanctions if North Korea continues with its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.
Hours before the U.N. vote on Thursday, North Korea threatened a nuclear strike against the U.S. North Korea doesn't have the capability to reach U.S. territory, military analysts say.
With U.S. and South Korean forces conducting annual defensive military maneuvers this week, North Korea also threatened to turn its neighbor to the south into "a sea of flames."
South Korea responded with its own warning. "North Korea will pay a dear price for its illicit activities and wrongdoings," said Kim Sook, South Korea's U.N. ambassador. Mr. Kim said the North's latest provocations, "whether rhetorical or physical, are completely unacceptable and we will deal with it resolutely."
China and Russia emphasized the new Security Council resolution's call for the resumption of six-party talks with North Korea, which pulled out of the negotiations in 2009. South Korea, the U.S. and Japan were the other participants in the talks.
"The top priority now is to defuse the tension, bring down the heat and focus on the diplomatic track," said Ambassador Li Baodong of China, which drafted the resolution with the U.S.
The fourth round of U.N. sanctions against North Korea since 2006 calls for a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. It also requires nations to police North Korean international trade and financial activities.
"When North Korea tries to move money to pay for its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs, countries must now block those transfers even if the money is being carried in suitcases full of bulk cash," said Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the U.N.
New measures ban the export to North Korea of luxury items such as yachts and luxury automobiles. "North Korea's ruling elite, who have been living large while impoverishing their people, will pay a direct price for this nuclear test," Ms. Rice said.
The resolution calls on nations to monitor North Korean diplomats for signs that they are working to further Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
"Taken together, these sanctions will bite and bite hard," Ms. Rice said. "They increase North Korea's isolation and raise the cost to North Korea's leaders of defying the international community."

Abstract: Mr. Chavez's free-spending ways reduced poverty, but he also concentrated power, divided his population, and left an economy hobbled by corruption, inefficiency and almost entirely dependent on high oil prices, many observers say. "The risk is that his revolution may survive him." Since taking office in 2009, the Obama administration sought to ignore provocations from Mr.\n

Full text:   Mourners pressed tight around the flag-draped coffin of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Caracas on Wednesday, but his death reached beyond the nation's borders, auguring the passing of the fiery brand of socialism he bankrolled and nurtured across Latin America.
Cuba, Venezuela's closest ally, is struggling economically. Argentina is beset by inflation. Ecuador and Bolivia are more absorbed by internal politics than ideological struggles. And nations with close U.S. ties, like Mexico, are making economic gains by comparison.
Mr. Chavez's death and the troubles for his allies are likely to cement the recent rise of a pragmatic brand of leftist politics practiced by ruling parties in Brazil, Peru and Uruguay, whom he sometimes overshadowed. It also presents an opening for the U.S. to rebuild relationships across South America.
During his 14 years in power, the populist former tank commander emerged as the figurehead of anti-American, left-wing politics in the region.
With Fidel Castro's sway having waned since the Cold War's end, Mr. Chavez took the mantle of "revolutionary" fighting U.S. "imperialism." He once famously called former President George W. Bush "the devil" and cultivated allies from China to Iran.
For years, Mr. Chvez gained admirers and influence in the region by giving billions of dollars worth of oil to Cuba, Nicaragua and others. He helped like-minded populists in Argentina, Bolivia and Ecuador, and pushed a trade bloc and a multilateral body that excluded the U.S.
Other leaders from around the region flocked to Caracas on Wednesday, including presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia, Cristina Kirchner of Argentina and Jose "Pepe" Mujica of Uruguay, honoring the late president at a mall dedicated to Venezuela's independence.
"The flags of liberty that Chavez raised will keep waving. . .he lives in our promise to continue the revolution," said President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.
Mr. Chavez's coffin was paraded through the streets of the capital, a day after Vice President Nicolas Maduro broke the news to his countrymen that he had died. Venezuelan authorities promised to maintain order and asked for calm.
Mr. Maduro, who on Wednesday signed a decree making him acting president, must call an election within a month, and political experts expect him to beat Henrique Capriles, who lost to Mr. Chavez in October and on Wednesday emerged as a candidate again.
Most analysts say Mr. Maduro, a one-time bus driver, lacks the flair needed to stir legions of followers and carry on Mr. Chavez's influence in the region. And with Venezuela facing deepening economic woes, Mr. Maduro would also lack the flexibility to employ oil diplomacy in the region.
Most Venezuelans say they would prefer their oil money spent at home rather than abroad. If Mr. Capriles were to win upcoming elections, he said he would end most aid to Cuba.
Even before he died on Tuesday after a 20-month battle with cancer, Mr. Chavez's model had lost much of its appeal, mostly because it failed at home.
Mr. Chavez's free-spending ways reduced poverty, but he also concentrated power, divided his population, and left an economy hobbled by corruption, inefficiency and almost entirely dependent on high oil prices, many observers say.
"You've already seen a turn away from Chavez's '21st century socialism,'" said Shannon O'Neil, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank. "Now, that view has lost its loudest voice."
In other countries of Latin America, there are already signs that Mr. Chavez's style is being edged out by a more moderate and market-friendly version, said Daniel Hoyos, director of the department of economics at the Universidad Nacional del Centro in Buenos Aires.
Many such leaders of the left "have not given up their ideas, but they've bathed them in a big dose of realism," said Mr. Hoyos.
He cited recent left-leaning leaders in Chile, as well as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and Mr. Mujica, both of whom were imprisoned as leftist guerrillas in their youth but have reinvented themselves through politics as pragmatists.
The region has also seen the rise of a group of countries that includes Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia that all have free-trade deals with the U.S. and Europe. They have economies that are lately growing faster and are more stable than Venezuela and Argentina, where inflation is high and growth has slowed.
For the U.S., the removal of a longtime critic could ease some of the polarization that has characterized the region over the past decade and open a path to more normal relations with Venezuela.
"The opportunity is that the revolutionary who had the deepest pockets is gone," said Otto Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela under George W. Bush and a vocal critic of Venezuela's regime. "The risk is that his revolution may survive him."
Since taking office in 2009, the Obama administration sought to ignore provocations from Mr. Chavez, including the expulsion of U.S. diplomats and a barrage of anti-American rhetoric. In November, Washington's top diplomat for the region, Roberta Jacobson, called Mr. Maduro to discuss how to improve ties.
Hopes for cozier dealings in the short-run, however, seem unlikely.
Mr. Maduro on Tuesday expelled two U.S. military attaches in Caracas for allegedly trying to foment conspiracy within the Venezuelan armed forces, and even suggested that the U.S. and other "enemies" somehow poisoned Mr. Chavez and gave him cancer. U.S. officials are reviewing whether to reciprocate with the expulsion of Venezuelan diplomats.
Some experts say anti-U.S. rhetoric is bound to continue for the near term as Mr. Maduro seeks to project a tough stance and solidify his power ahead of next month's polls.
"Maduro will want to continue this idea as U.S. as external threat and get the Venezuelans to rally around him," said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas, an organization that promotes free trade in the region.
He said the country may see a new wave of nationalizations and public spending as Mr. Maduro seeks to make his mark as Chavez's heir.
Despite Mr. Maduro's best attempts, the region lacks a natural heir to Mr. Chavez. Ecuador's president, populist Rafael Correa, mimics Mr. Chavez's verbal jousting.
But analysts say he is focused on solidifying his power in Ecuador -- and unlikely to push his populist vision across the continent. While Mr. Correa is a strong critic of neo-liberal trade polices, the U.S.-educated economist also sees a role for the private sector in the economy and hasn't done widespread nationalizations like Mr. Chavez did.
Mrs. Kirchner of Argentina gained notoriety on the global stage for anti-free market moves. But analysts say she, too, is currently tied up with domestic issues, such as inflation running at an estimated 25% and a battle with media group Clarin.
"All the other [leftist] leaders are faced with their own domestic problems right now, and they don't have the wealth that allowed Chavez to spend like a drunken sailor," Mr. Farnsworth said.

Full text:   A major test of China's promise to consolidate its solar-panel makers looms this month when one of the industry's biggest companies faces a deadline for making a large bond payment.
In December, China's State Council, or cabinet, signaled it would stop funding money-losing domestic solar-panel makers, which are caught up in a global downturn for the industry, and instead encourage mergers among its major companies. It also indicated it would ban local governments from supporting them and allow the market to determine winners and losers.
A decision point for this policy shift comes on March 15, when Suntech Power Holdings Co., one of the world's largest solar-panel suppliers, needs to repay more than a half billion dollars of debt held by international investors. The company last reported a net cash position of $244 million as of Aug. 31 and debt of about $2 billion.
Suntech is still in talks with bondholders ahead of the deadline. A Suntech spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would repay the $541 million owed to bondholders.
Suntech said last November it was considering restructuring its foreign debt or making an exchange offer to foreign bondholders. The company said then that "credit support" from Chinese lenders "to repay offshore debt is not available," according to a presentation for investors. The company said it didn't believe it would be able to issue bonds in China to raise cash and that it didn't have assets it could sell that would raise enough money to pay off its debt.
In December, Suntech said it expected third-quarter revenue would drop by half, to $387 million, compared with a year earlier, and that 2012 shipments of its panels would be less than the company earlier forecast. The company said early this week that its founder, Zhengrong Shi, stepped down as chairman, less than seven months after he resigned as chief executive. However, Mr. Shi said in a later statement he was improperly removed as chairman and that he was committed to staying.
Amid record-setting pollution in Beijing and predictions that solar power will be the world's largest primary source of energy in 50 years, China has continued to support its solar industries, even as U.S. and European solar-equipment manufacturers have been forced into restructuring or bankruptcy. Beijing has been sharply critical of anti-subsidy and dumping duties slapped on Chinese solar imports by Washington last year. In some cases, Chinese companies have received life support by loans from friendly banks that have helped them restructure debt and by fresh capital from state-backed investors and local governments.
China's 10 largest listed solar companies -- including Suntech, Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. and LDK Solar Co. -- had combined debt of $17.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of last year, according to U.S.-based investment bank Maxim Group.
In January, LDK said it received a $31 million cash infusion from Chinese investor Fulai Investments Ltd., for about 12% of LDK stock. The solar-wafer company also said it received a loan of 440 million yuan ($70.5 million) from China Development Bank in January to upgrade a polysilicon plant.
Still, domestic support for Chinese companies may not last. Chen Yuan, chairman of China Development Bank, said Tuesday on the sidelines of China's annual session of parliament that the bank would limit fresh lending to solar-panel companies. CDB's credit exposure to China's solar sector was more than $7 billion in 2011, by far the largest among Chinese state-owned banks, according to ChinaScope Financial, a data provider.
Meanwhile, with its weak balance sheet, Wuxi, China-based Suntech, whose American depositary receipts trade in New York, faces the prospect of having to make a $541 million bond payment due March 15 on its own.
The industry's debt grew rapidly between 2009 and 2011 to fund expansion of manufacturing capacity. Although global solar-power demand has grown each year, it hasn't kept pace with the manufacturing boom, causing solar-panel makers to cut costs and write down investments while they hunt for new markets. European demand in particular has been hit by the EU's economic crisis and the rolling back of clean-energy subsidies.
Although the Chinese government likely will provide financial help to keep Suntech's factories operating and its workers employed, it is unclear whether China would "bail out American investors who simply got into the wrong company," said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James Associates in New York.
Mr. Molchanov predicted that Suntech will have to restructure its debt and that shareholders will end up with little or nothing.
The Suntech bonds coming due March 15 traded Wednesday at $40 per $100 of the bonds' original value, according to e-trading platform MarketAxess.
Most of Suntech's foreign bondholders are specialty shops or distressed funds, according to Ipreo, a data firm. Mount Kellett Capital Management was the top foreign bondholder, with about $26 million worth of Suntech convertible notes, according to Ipreo. Mount Kellett declined to comment on the bonds. Other top holders included Driehaus Capital Management, Pioneer Investment Management and Silverback Asset Management. Those firms declined to comment.
The bonds are a type of debt known as convertible notes, which enable investors to convert the bonds into stock at a predetermined price. For these bonds, that price is $41 a share. Suntech shares closed Wednesday in New York at $1.18, down about 20% year-to-date, making the conversion component of the bonds worthless to investors.
Last year, Suntech and several Chinese solar companies whose American depositary receipts are traded in New York were told they could be delisted due to the collapse in their share prices to below $1. Since then, most have climbed out of the danger zone.
Suntech's March 15 debt payment marks the first time a Chinese solar firm has been under pressure to pay foreign creditors, said Nitin Kumar, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. Although Chinese creditors have tended to be more forgiving about repayment schedules and terms, foreign bondholders may be less willing, Mr. Kumar said.
Beijing is offering indirect help to solar companies in the form of new policies and incentives for solar-power development and to boost demand for panels. That is in line with the government's plan to have clean energy account for 11.4% of power consumption by 2015.

Full text:   BEIJING -- A fight is breaking out among the top ranks of a major Chinese solar company just days before a deadline to make a $541 million bond payment.
Zhengrong Shi, the founder of U.S.-listed Suntech Power Holdings Co., said on Wednesday that he was improperly removed as chairman and that he was committed to staying. In a statement, he called the move "misconceived and unlawful."
In an interview, Mr. Shi said Suntech management should be focusing on the convertible bond payment coming due, the company's restructuring and improving operations. "I don't admit that all I did was right, but now the whole industry is facing challenges," he said. "Of course, I will take some responsibility for myself but I think that we need to focus on the solution."
"As the founder, largest shareholder and director, I will do everything to save the company," he added.
Mr. Shi said he has been excluded from negotiations with Suntech's bondholders and issues related to restructuring and refinancing the company for more than a month, but said all parties were open to negotiating.
Suntech on Monday named Susan Wang as successor to Mr. Shi and said he would remain chief strategy officer and a director. In a statement Wednesday, the board said it is "confident" that Ms. Wang's appointment to replace Mr. Shi "is valid and effective under the law of the Cayman Islands, the country of the Company's incorporation."
The clash over Mr. Shi's departure marks the latest hit to a company once touted as a flagship of China's renewable-energy ambitions. China has moved to increase its share of energy from solar, wind and other renewable sources to reduce its dependence on imports and to address its severe pollution problems. Chinese officials have also sought to shift into high-end, technical manufacturing.
Mr. Shi owns roughly 29% of the company's shares, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Suntech, based in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi, is one of the world's largest producers of solar panels. Its results have been hurt by a global glut in solar-panel production, fueling trade disputes in the U.S. and the European Union against Chinese solar manufacturers.
Suntech is in talks with international investors ahead of a March 15 deadline to make a $541 million bond payment. The company declined to disclose details of the talks.

Full text:   Standard Chartered PLC said it sees a rosier economic outlook for many of its key Asian markets this year, after a global slowdown put the brakes on the lender's profit growth last year.
The emerging-markets-focused bank posted a net profit of $4.79 billion in 2012, up 0.8% from $4.75 billion in 2011, a significant slowdown from the 12% growth rate it recorded a year earlier. Standard Chartered is based in the U.K., but makes about 90% of its profit in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and reports in U.S. dollars.
Revenue rose 8.1%, to $19.07 billion from $17.64 billion, lower than the 10% growth rate recorded in 2011.
Chief Executive Peter Sands said business has been strong so far this year in both consumer and wholesale banking, and that the bank "remains a growth story" for investors. Standard Chartered has outperformed many of its U.S. and European peers in the past several years because of its focus on emerging markets and limited exposure to the euro zone's fiscal problems.
Yet the bank gave a cautious outlook for the world economy, and said recent uncertainties "have brought more subdued economic growth in some of our footprint countries."
"It gets harder to deliver the same rates of growth as we get bigger," Mr. Sands said Tuesday.
But he said the bank will likely increase revenue by at least 10% in 2013, as some markets, such as China, continue to expand rapidly.
Reflecting investors' confidence, the bank's share price leapt 3.2% Tuesday in London.
In Hong Kong, Standard Chartered's largest market by revenue, the pace of revenue growth dropped to 10% in 2012, less than half of 2011's 22% rate. Revenue in Singapore, the bank's No. 2 market, was only slightly higher in 2012, after surging 26% in 2011.
Hong Kong's economy rose just 1.4% in 2012, following 4.9% growth in 2011.
India, a recent concern for the lender after a slowdown in activity last year, posted a 12% revenue decline for 2012. The bank said the mood in the country has changed noticeably since the summer, and that "business and investor activity has undoubtedly picked up."
India initiated a series of economic and business measures last fall, after a sharp slowdown in output.
Some countries remain on the upswing in terms of revenue, including mainland China, where revenue rose 21% in 2012 to $1 billion, surpassing 2011's 17% growth rate. Revenue in Nigeria was $258 million in 2012, a 12-fold increase on the $21 million it produced in 2003.
In all, the bank said 25 markets rose at a double-digit rate. It is active in about 70 countries.
Standard Chartered said 2012 represented its 10th consecutive year of growth, both in terms of revenue and pretax profit. Through its retail and wholesale banks, the bank aims to tap demographic and economic trends in emerging markets, such as a growing middle class in Asia and Africa, and increased business connectivity between developing countries. Mr. Sands gave the examples of rising trade between Africa and India, and between China and the Middle East.
"Revenue growth is a rare commodity," said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at financial services provider Investec, pointing out that every other major U.K. bank, including HSBC Holdings PLC and Barclays PLC, posted revenue declines in 2012. He predicted Standard Chartered would have no problem increasing revenue at a double-digit pace this year.
But in another sign of how a weaker economy is hitting some consumers and businesses, bad loans at the group jumped 34% to $1.22 billion. More than half of the rise came from customers in Standard Chartered's retail bank.
Impaired consumer loans in Singapore more than doubled, to $62 million from $29 million.
Mr. Sands said underlying profit rose 12%, after stripping out items that included a $667 million settlement with U.S. authorities over Iranian-client transactions that may have violated U.S. sanctions. The bank apologized for the failures in its systems.

Abstract: Diplomats and analysts say Mr. Xi has moved faster than expected to establish himself as a strong military leader, making a series of high-profile visits to army, navy, air force and missile-command facilities in his first 100 days in office, and launching a campaign to enhance the armed forces' ability to "fight and win wars," according to diplomats and analysts.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China's new leader, Xi Jinping, appears to be ingratiating himself with the country's generals by protecting the defense budget even as economic growth slows. He also is cultivating a public image as a strong military leader as China faces off with Japan over a group of disputed islands and seeks to counteract the U.S. strategic pivot toward Asia.
A national budget unveiled Tuesday at the opening of an annual meeting of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, forecast military expenditure of $114.3 billion, an increase of 10.7%, in 2013.
It is the first budget since Mr. Xi took over as Communist Party and military chief in a once-a-decade leadership change in November. Military spending has increased at a similar rate for most of the past two decades, but this year's increase comes as China's overall economic growth begins to slow.
Diplomats and analysts say Mr. Xi has moved faster than expected to establish himself as a strong military leader, making a series of high-profile visits to army, navy, air force and missile-command facilities in his first 100 days in office, and launching a campaign to enhance the armed forces' ability to "fight and win wars," according to diplomats and analysts.
Those people say Mr. Xi has taken direct control of an interagency body that has overseen an escalation in Chinese civilian and military patrols around islands claimed by both China and Japan, leading to frequent confrontations with Japanese ships and planes that many regional defense experts say could escalate into military conflict.
Mr. Xi's more dynamic military profile is mainly designed to build up a political support base within the armed forces, and cultivate a public image that distinguishes him from his predecessor, Hu Jintao, who struggled to establish his authority over the armed forces and was widely viewed as a weak and uncharismatic leader, say diplomats and analysts.
But the U.S. and other foreign governments are watching for indications that Mr. Xi's apparently closer ties with the military might result in a continuation, or even an escalation, of China's recent assertive behavior, especially in relation to the country's territorial disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea.
That assertiveness, combined with China's rapid development of military capabilities designed to deny U.S. forces access to waters near its shores, was among the factors behind the Obama administration's decision last year to bolster defense and trade ties in Asia. China has denounced that as a ploy to contain its economic and military rise.
The official military spending for 2012 was around $106 billion, which was an 11.2% rise from 2011.
China says its defense budget is expanding in line with its economic growth, but isn't directed at any other country. The figure is usually unveiled at a news conference the day before the parliament session begins, but Fu Ying, a vice foreign minister who is spokeswoman for the parliament session, declined to reveal the number on Monday.
"It seems China needs to explain every year to the outside world why we are strengthening national defense and why we are increasing military spending," she said. "If a large country like China cannot protect its own security, that won't be good news for the world," she said.
Experts on the Chinese military have long argued that China's real defense budget is much higher than the official figure, which doesn't include big-ticket items such as arms imports and military components of the space program.
Last year, the Pentagon estimated China's actual military spending in 2011 at between $120 billion and $180 billion.
However, an article by two Western scholars to be included in this month's China Quarterly academic journal argues that China's official military budget increasingly reflects actual spending, and includes some items that aren't usually calculated as part of Western defense budgets.
"Increases in the official defense budget are roughly consistent with GDP growth and constitute a declining percentage of central government expenditures," wrote Adam Liff, a doctoral candidate at Princeton University, and Andrew Erickson, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval War College.

Full text:   By the glow of six flat screens inside a windowless room in a California office tower, three content cops from NBCUniversal watch as pirated versions of the cable-TV drama "Suits" begin popping up on the Internet within minutes of the show's closing credits.
At first, they come in ones and twos, but in an hour there are 444 unauthorized links to that Thursday night's episode on its USA Network. In two hours more, that number more than doubles, opening up the show to millions of Web viewers around the world as translations into languages as varied as Bulgarian and Chinese begin to roll out.
As the pirates click away, the three on the digital beat fire off menacing notices to the website operators hosting the illegal episode, demanding they pull it down.
"It's like whack-a-mole," says Andrew Skinner, the manager of content security for NBCUniversal. "You knock off one and there are 50 more behind it."
Content pirates have sailed the World Wide Web since its earliest days, but today they are bolder, faster and better armed with technology than ever. By many measures, the pirates are ahead. The antipiracy and security firm Irdeto, which works with some of the content companies, said that in 2009 it detected 5.4 billion instances of pirated content online, from movies and television shows to videogames. Last year, that number jumped to more than 14 billion.
Many of the big content companies have operations like NBCUniversal's in Los Angeles, but they usually are kept out of the public eye. NBCUniversal gave The Wall Street Journal a rare peek inside the cat-and-mouse game its security team plays with suspected pirates. The cops launch armies of automated "crawlers" to hunt unauthorized videos, for instance, while pirates fight back in some cases with captchas, those on-screen boxes that require users to replicate numbers and letters from those in a distorted image on the website.
"We're up against a whole ocean" of piracy, Mr. Skinner says.
This ocean could eventually reduce the television industry's profit, much of which now comes from subscription fees on cable channels like USA and Time Warner Inc.'s HBO. Pirated versions of shows make it much easier for viewers to forgo pay television. They also squeeze another vital profit source of the TV industry: the rental or sale of movies and television shows to consumers or their licensing to other TV networks and online services like Netflix Inc.
HBO's Game of Thrones spotlights the issue. More than 11 million HBO subscribers watched each episode of the show's second season in the U.S. last year. From peer-to-peer sites alone, which allow users to share content directly among themselves without it passing through a central point, another 3.7 to 4.2 million people around the world watched pirated versions of each episode, up 38% from the show's first season, according to an estimate by TorrentFreak.com, a blog about file sharing. An HBO spokesman said the company "has a comprehensive antipiracy program in place, and we believe that the effectiveness of that program is evidenced in part by the continued success of our business."
Last year, Kathy Wolfe, who owns a small independent U.S. film-distribution company, Wolfe Video, found more than 903,000 links to unauthorized versions of her films, which she sells around the world for $3.99 per download. She estimates that she lost over $3 million in revenue in 2012 as a result of stolen content from her top 15 titles. On top of that, she spends over $30,000 a year -- about half her profit -- just to send out takedown notices for her titles. She said the losses to piracy, combined with the recent recession, forced her to trim her marketing budget in half, cut pay for her 11 employees and stop giving herself a salary. "It's changed us," she said. "It's a very damaging trend."
As for NBCUniversal, its profits are still robust, with operating cash flow climbing to $4.1 billion last year, from $3.8 billion in 2011, thanks largely from the strength of cable networks like USA. But Rick Cotton, general counsel of NBCUniversal, who oversees the company's antipiracy unit, said piracy is a particularly big problem overseas. For example, he said that revenue for its Spanish home-entertainment unit declined 62% between 2009 and 2011, mainly because of piracy, and NBC shut it down.
"Is the evolution of TV and movie viewing going to go legitimately digital or to pirates?" Mr. Cotton asked.
Some TV executives worry that they may follow in the steps of the music industry, which has seen its global sales plummet from some $29 billion in 1999 to about half that today, partly because of its slowness to respond to online demand after pirated songs became widely available on the Internet.
The explosion in pirated TV shows and movies is more recent because of improved Web technology. Faster Internet speeds have eliminated the hourslong process of downloading longer videos from peer-to-peer networks and online storage sites called cyberlockers. Much illegal content has also become available through instant streams, including live sports.
"It has taken the arrival of high-speed broadband to make that attractive," said James Grimmelmann, a piracy expert and professor at New York Law School.
The filing-sharing technology BitTorrent is one tool pirates use to trade videos on websites. BitTorrent, which has many legitimate applications, breaks up large computer files into small pieces so they can zip across the Web. One peer-to-peer site using the technology, ThePirateBay.se, advises people, "Any complaints from copyright and/or lobby organizations will be ridiculed and published at the site." PirateBay, which is the 74th most trafficked site in the world, according to the tracking company Alexa, didn't respond to requests for comment.
The Motion Picture Association of America, Hollywood's lobbying organization, has said that piracy of content costs the economy $58 billion a year, including theft of content, lost entertainment jobs and taxes lost to the federal and state government. Some have called that number exaggerated, while the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a 2010 report that the economic impact was "extremely difficult" to gauge.
An attempt to attack the problem through Congress, with the Stop Online Piracy Act, failed last January when Silicon Valley companies said, among other things, the bill would limit free expression online.
Without another bill planned, media companies have been working with others in the Web community to battle digital thieves. Google, for instance, just adjusted its algorithm to obscure search results for sites with pirated content. And the five major Internet service providers, including NBC's parent company, Comcast, last week began an alert system. It notifies users suspected of piracy and results in progressive penalties, including in some cases slowed Web access.
Another focus is online-ad networks, which media companies say help finance piracy by placing ads on sites that traffic in unauthorized content. A study last summer, commissioned in part by Google, found that 86% of peer-to-peer sharing sites are dependent on advertising for income.
NBC's special unit said it recently discovered advertisements for Blockbuster and the U.S. Forest Service on cyberlockers that had trafficked in its content without permission. The ads had been supplied through Google's AdSense, which places ads related to keywords.
Blockbuster said it had "policies and controls" to stop improper ad placement, but called it an "ongoing challenge." The Ad Council, which handles ads for the Forest Service, said any time its ads ran on questionable sites, it requested that they be taken down immediately.
After a request from NBC, Google removed the ads, said NBCUniversal's Mr. Cotton.
A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on the ads but said that, as a policy, AdSense ads aren't supposed to be displayed on sites that contain or link to copyright-infringing content. She noted that the company disables "thousands of accounts proactively, as well as at the result of requests."
Since about 2011, NBC has nearly doubled the size of its full-time antipiracy staff to 20, with offices around the world. The core team includes gaming geeks like Mr. Skinner, data crunchers, litigators and techies who know their way around the Web's darker places.
"We're trying to disrupt this world," Mr. Cotton said.
Mr. Skinner's six-person team operates from a room at NBCUniversal's film-studio lot that has the feel of a battleship control center. Its entry door has no sign.
"It's so top secret we can't even find it," one executive joked.
Working around the clock, the team, along with paid outside contractors, blasts off tens of thousands of takedown notices a week to website operators. The team also builds files against suspect websites and sometimes shares them with law enforcement.
Some sites quickly remove the offending videos. Others don't. The team said it has had particular problems getting action from sites located in the Netherlands, China, and Russia.
NBC also applies "content recognition" technology to its programming, which it then passes on to video sites like YouTube to help block illegal uploads. NBC sends out a digital snapshot of the show, which YouTube and other video sites input into their systems, preventing users from putting up the copyrighted show.
"And look at this," said the goateed Mr. Skinner, as he navigated his browser to TV-Links.eu, which provides links to other sites with full-length television shows and movies, among other things. His search for the first episode in the second season of USA's "Suits" only turned up four paid links, where episodes could be properly downloaded. "They hide results from us," said Mr. Skinner.
As a standard defense measure against the kind of robot crawlers used by NBC to trawl for links, some sites block or limit the view of Internet protocol addresses -- numbers that identify the computer of each person using the Internet -- that visit a site too much. "But now watch," Mr. Skinner said, activating a proxy to hide the identity of his computer, which allowed it to enter the site anonymously.
Suddenly, in addition to the links to paid TV destinations, others appeared for free unauthorized episodes of the show. "A live one!" Mr. Skinner said as he followed one path to a cyberlocker, Movreel.com, where the episode began to play. He shot off a takedown notice to Movreel.
Adrian Constantin, the chairman of Interakt, which owns TV-Links, said while "some infringement" was inevitable, the site responds promptly to takedown requests and bans users whose activities prompt repeated complaints from content owners.
Mr. Constantin added that 5% of his site is user-generated content and that TVLinks "freely sends millions of visitors to websites that belong to content creators or their distributors each month."
A spokesman for Movreel said in an email: "If you own any content being hosted on our site, just send us a valid complaint and the content will be removed."
In 2009, Mr. Skinner's unit sent out 427,000 takedown notices. But last year, as illicit videos became more prevalent, that number grew to 3.9 million. For "Suits," the unit has sent out more than 40,000 notices.
NBC said it is too early to know the effectiveness of takedown notices, though Mr. Cotton calls them a necessary policing move in a vast netherworld. "What would the level of crime be in a city without a police department?"
Occasionally the takedowns escalate into lawsuits. Two years ago, after thousands of notices, NBCUniversal joined a suit with four other Hollywood studios and the Motion Picture Association of America against a file-sharing site called Hotfile, accusing it of stealing copyrighted content "on a staggering scale."
A spokesman for Hotfile said the studios had been provided with a way to take down unauthorized content, and argued that the lawsuit is about the studios fighting technology. A ruling is expected this spring.
NBC recently shared intelligence with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement for an investigation that ended with the closing of 16 websites where fans had sought free broadcasts of live sporting events, including National Hockey League, National Basketball Association and National Football League games. Pirated sports coverage is especially worrisome for networks that spend billions for broadcast rights to athletic events.
Nine of the websites were run by a 28-year-old Michigan man named Yonjo Quiroa, federal prosecutors said in documents, which also said that he had made thousands of dollars off the ads on those sites.
The investigation led to the arrest of Mr. Quiroa for copyright infringement. Soon after, the 16 websites, among them firstrowsports.net, were emblazoned with a forbidding message: "Seized." Later, Mr. Quiroa pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.
In the end, though, Mr. Cotton acknowledges that the pirates won't be disappearing soon. "What I lose sleep about is that we're moving too slow," he said. "How do we protect ourselves? Where are we in this transition? That is a vital question because our future is digital."

Abstract: Continued indications that the Federal Reserve isn't eager to raise interest rates any time soon also are helping stocks, by keeping bonds unattractive and allowing companies and individuals to borrow money at puny rates. For the first time on record, the cash-flow yield of stocks is higher than yields that junk bonds currently pay, suggesting that stocks are more attractive than junk bonds, according to BMO Private Bank.

Full text:   The market is surmounting a wall of worries to approach all-time highs. The best news: There are reasons to think the good times will continue.
After a choppy run last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 7.5% for the year while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 6.5%. The Dow is now just 75 points from its all-time high, reached on Oct. 9, 2007, while the S&P 500 is 47 points away from its record, set on the same day six years ago.
Behind the sharp recent gains: impressive corporate earnings, a rebounding U.S. housing market and improvements in Europe and China. Continued indications that the Federal Reserve isn't eager to raise interest rates any time soon also are helping stocks, by keeping bonds unattractive and allowing companies and individuals to borrow money at puny rates.
The climb has come despite hand wringing about a string of issues, from a political squabble that has forced cutbacks on the government to a U.S. economy dealing with lackluster growth.
Stocks remain reasonably priced, despite the market's gains since November, so investors shouldn't race for the exits, some analysts say. Stocks in the S&P 500 index trade at less than 15 times their earnings over the last year, and about 13.5 times their expected earnings over the next 12 months. Both are reasonable multiples based on historical ratios.
Stocks also look attractive based on cash flow, which many investors argue is a better barometer of a company's strength than reported earnings. Stocks trade at a "cash-flow yield," which reflects a stock's cash flow as a percentage of its price, of about 7%.
That figure has come down over the past year, suggesting that stocks have become less attractive during that time.
But the 7% figure is in line with the average of the last three years and higher than the entire previous decade. For the first time on record, the cash-flow yield of stocks is higher than yields that junk bonds currently pay, suggesting that stocks are more attractive than junk bonds, according to BMO Private Bank.
"Stocks are fairly priced relative to traditional metrics, like earnings and revenues," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank. "They're cheap relative to bonds."
Meanwhile, the dividend yield of the 100 largest companies in the S&P 500 is expected to be about 2.6% this year, well above the 1.9% yield of 10-year Treasury notes. That's another reason to think stocks are more reasonably priced than bonds, a reason money has shifted to equities from bonds.
A spate of recent mergers and buyouts is more good news, some argue. Billion-dollar deals for Dell, H.J. Heinz, Virgin Media and other companies suggest to some that stocks are attractive because savvy buyers are willing to make these big purchases.
"If investors, treasurers and arbitragers get more optimistic, we could see more" buyouts, takeovers and stock buybacks, which might help stocks, Mr. Ablin says.
While individual investors are beginning to get more excited about stocks, they're still sitting on piles of cash, suggesting more money could move into the stock market. Over the past four years, investors have plowed more than $1 trillion into bond mutual funds, while pulling $500 billion from U.S.-oriented stock funds, according to Citigroup.
"Investors may be on the cusp of a major reallocation back toward equities," argues Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist.
To be sure, the valuation picture isn't quite as rosy based on other metrics. One favored by Robert Shiller of Yale University that measures stock prices against average corporate earnings of the last decade shows stocks trading at nearly 23 times earnings, well above the historical average of 16. Some favor this measure because using a decade of profits makes it less volatile.
Bears also worry that profit margins are at record peaks and likely to fall, and that the U.S. and global economies remain fragile. Economists expect the U.S. economy to grow about 1.5% this year, a meager figure that comes on top of growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. Goldman Sachs predicts growth will be 2.9% next year and that investors will begin to anticipate the improvement later this year.
For now, markets have largely shrugged off the continuing tussle in Washington between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans over the budget, though the resulting across-the-board budget cuts--which started taking effect on Friday--will serve to further slow the economy.
In the bond market, there's more evidence of danger. Junk bonds and other riskier debt have been so popular, and the volume of new sales of junk bonds has been so strong that some economists and analysts have turned wary. In early February, Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein said "we are seeing a fairly significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior," or investors buying riskier debt with higher yields.
William Gross, manager of the world's largest bond fund at Pimco, recently wrote that stock and bond valuations are becoming stretched, but not yet at levels where investors should sell the bulk of their portfolios.
"On a scale of 1-10 measuring asset price 'irrationality,' we are probably at a 6 and moving in an upward direction" he wrote.
What investors need to do, Mr. Gross argues, it to stay invested in the market, but temper their expectations about future returns.
"Recent double-digit returns are unlikely to be replicated," Mr. Gross wrote, pointing to potential annual gains of 5% to 6% over the next few years.
Over the next few months, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, argues, the fiscal drama and Europe's challenges won't matter as much for the market as whether the U.S. job picture improves. What to watch out for: housing and retail sales further strengthening, and investors shifting even more of their holdings from bonds to stocks.

Full text:   Corrections & Amplifications
A recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Las Vegas Sands Corp. that said the company had found "likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions" of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act neither mentioned former President Bill Weidner nor accused him of wrongdoing. A Corporate News article about the filing in some editions on March 2 reported that Mr. Weidner was mentioned in an internal Sands report on the issue but didn't note that he hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing and wasn't named in the SEC filing.
(WSJ March 22, 2013)
Subscribe to WSJ:
Las Vegas Sands Corp. told the Securities and Exchange Commission that an internal review found the casino operator had likely violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law that bans bribing public officials abroad.
The company on Friday said in its annual report that its board's audit committee had advised the company and its accountants that it had reached a preliminary finding that there were "likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions" of the antibribery law.
The findings relate to a series of business deals conducted in mainland China and led by executives who are no longer with the company, according to a person familiar with the matter. The findings from the board's audit committee were first reported by The Wall Street Journal last August.
Friday's filing was the company's first official disclosure on the matter.
Spokesman Ron Reese said he had no comment on the findings or on the China dealings.
The company concluded that the preliminary findings don't have a material impact on the company's financial statements or indicate a material weakness in the company's internal controls, according to the filing. In recent years the company has improved its practices, it said.
Sands disclosed two years ago that it was being investigated for FCPA violations by the SEC and Justice Department. The investigation, which the company says stemmed from a civil suit filed in Nevada by the former head of its China subsidiary, is still continuing. The company has denied wrongdoing in the civil suit.
In response to the federal investigation, Sands hired O'Melveny & Myers LLP to conduct an investigation on behalf of the board and then turn over information to the Justice Department. The law firm declined to comment. Investigators last year began reporting preliminary findings to federal investigators and to Nevada gambling regulators, who are also conducting investigations, according to people familiar with the matter.
As part of that presentation, the board investigators said that previous managers, including former president Bill Weidner, had led a series of deals in mainland China that may have lacked proper bookkeeping controls, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The deals were conducted during the early days of the company's Asia expansion last decade, when it was seeking to network in mainland China in order to help its then-new casino business in Macau, the booming Chinese gambling enclave.
Mr. Weidner couldn't be reached for comment Friday. In August he said in a statement that there was no evidence the transactions would be considered illegal in the U.S. and he called the board's investigation's focus on prior management a "distraction sideshow" to protect current management.
The deals include a failed attempt to build a trade organization in Beijing bearing the name of Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson and a sponsorship of a basketball team in China, according to people familiar with the matter and documents viewed by the Journal.
The audit committee didn't doubt the integrity of current senior management, according to the copy of the preliminary report viewed by the Journal in August.
According to the report, the issue of deficient controls and records had previously been investigated internally and the board adopted new internal measures in February 2010 to address the problem.

Full text:   American manufacturers are doing better than many of their competitors around the world as increased spending by U.S. businesses and a revival in global trade creates more demand for their products.
The Institute for Supply Management said Friday that its gauge of U.S. factory activity expanded in February for the third straight month to 54.2 -- continuing the biggest jump in manufacturing activity since the economic recovery started in July 2009. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Exports jumped to a nine-month high, while new orders and order backlogs, both gauges of future business, rose sharply.
The report is evidence that increased spending by U.S. businesses and consumers, the housing recovery and an uptick in global trade are helping America's factories, which were a key engine for the nation's recovery three years ago but weakened recently amid a global economic slowdown. The report also suggests that manufacturers aren't nervous about the looming impact of the "sequester," the $85 billion in across-the-board government spending cuts that kicked in Friday.
Separate reports on Friday showed that Americans are still spending despite higher taxes, while confidence among consumers rose in February to its highest level since November.
The improving outlook for U.S. factories comes as factories in many other parts of the world are facing more headwinds. Manufacturing growth slowed in China, the world's second-biggest economy, though analysts said Lunar New Year festivities damped production. In the euro zone, factory activity is a mixed bag, but generally weak: The region's biggest economy, Germany, saw its factories start expanding again, but manufacturers in Italy, the bloc's third-biggest economy, slumped deeper into contraction territory. Britain's manufacturing activity unexpectedly shrank.
U.S. "manufacturers are now seeing a rebound in domestic demand, especially the early cyclical industries," said Joseph Carson, economist at Alliance Bernstein. "That's helping offset some of the more sluggish growth overseas."
The big drivers of manufacturing's latest rebound are a jump in business spending and a pickup in global trade, which is creating demand for U.S. exports. American businesses increased spending late last year after largely shelving investment plans before the U.S. election and keeping their inventories relatively light -- both of which could mean more orders for manufacturers early this year.
Meanwhile, U.S. exports to other countries helped keep the economy growing late last year, with trade adding nearly a quarter percentage point to the nation's growth rate, which itself was revised Thursday to show a 0.1% expansion instead of a 0.1% contraction.
Robert Livingston, chief executive of Dover Corp., a conglomerate that makes a variety of products like refrigeration equipment, says sales are picking up gradually this year thanks to improvements in the domestic and global economy.
The recovery of the housing market and increased car sales in the U.S. are boosting demand in the manufacturing sector, he said. "I do think 2013 will be better than the last two years."
Economists and corporate executives aren't expecting manufacturing to become a driver of the recovery the way it was three years ago.
But ISM's report suggests American manufacturers have gained traction after throttling back production last year. An index tracking new orders rose to 57.8, above January's 53.3 reading -- the biggest jump since March 2010 -- while a separate index for production rose to 57.6 from 53.6.
The "overall tone in manufacturing is clearly positive," said Brad Holcomb, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing-survey panel. "As for how sustainable this is, we suspect we will stay in a pretty tight range for the next couple of months."

Full text:   Add one more item to the list of products "made in China": debt backed by commercial mortgages.
Bank of China Ltd. already is one of the largest foreign lenders to commercial real estate in the U.S., helping finance prestige properties. Now, it is staking a claim in the red-hot market for bonds backed by packages of commercial-real-estate loans.
In November, Bank of China became the first Chinese lender to participate in the sale of U.S. commercial-mortgage-backed securities, known as CMBS. Bank of China joined a group of banks in a $950 million loan to finance a 43-story building at 1290 Ave. of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan that was then packaged into bonds.
The Chinese bank is planning loans that would end up in to two or three more CMBS deals, a person with knowledge of the bank said. State-controlled Bank of China earns a profit from selling loans via CMBS. It also frees up its balance sheet to make more loans. The bank uses its capital to lend at lower rates than many of its competitors, real-estate executives say.
Bank of China had $3.7 billion in commercial-property loans outstanding in its U.S. branches as of the fourth quarter, according to data provider Trepp LLC, almost four times the level in the same period of 2009.
"They are like the 1,000-pound gorilla in the room, where they have the capital to [lend at] very competitive terms," said Christopher Haynes, founder of loan adviser Broadacre Financial Corp. and a 20-year veteran of Merrill Lynch's real-estate team. "Securitization may be encouraging them to do even more."
The CMBS market is off to a record start this year. Investors are moving into riskier investments that offer higher yields, as the Federal Reserve's near-zero interest rates hold down returns on the safest debt, including Treasurys.
CMBS issuance is on track to reach $26 billion for the first quarter, more than four times the level from a year ago and the highest three-month total since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a trade publication. The $8.8 billion sold in January marked the biggest ever for that month.
Bank of China has focused on high-profile properties in New York with its forays into CMBS. The bank has tentatively agreed to provide about $600 million to help fund Chetrit Group's $1.1 billion purchase of the Sony Building in Manhattan, real-estate executives with direct knowledge of the deal said. That loan isn't likely to be packaged into a CMBS, however.
The latest securitization foray by Bank of China involved teaming up with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank on a $900 million loan on a 1.7 million-square-foot office and retail property in Manhattan's Times Square.
Lending on trophy assets in cities such as New York is a "prescient first step," said Edward Shugrue, chief executive at CMBS investor and servicer Talmage LLC. He said Bank of China is one of several state-backed firms in the U.S. commercial-real-estate market, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp.
Beijing-based Bank of China has become increasingly active as a lender to U.S. property developers since late 2009, joining scores of well-capitalized Chinese investors who have helped fuel a commercial-real-estate recovery in U.S. cities.
The bank is the third-biggest foreign property lender in the U.S., after TD Bank Group's Toronto-Dominion Bank and BMO Financial Group's Bank of Montreal, according to Trepp.
The Chinese bank has surpassed some German banks -- traditionally among the most active foreign property lenders in the U.S. -- that retreated from the U.S. market after suffering losses tied to loans made during the bubble years. For instance, Bank of China has moved past Germany's HSH Nordbank AG, the Trepp data show.
Bank of China's bet is that property values have fallen enough that its lending risks will be limited. However, the bank doesn't intend to become a licensed U.S. broker-dealer, which would allow it to issue CMBS on its own, rather than only contributing loans. In the long run, Bank of China plans to "invest more in personnel and broaden its distribution channel in the U.S.," said the person familiar with the bank.

World News: West Wary Over Talks, as Iran Hails Concessions

Abstract: Mr. Kerry also appeared to confer legitimacy on Iran's government, a departure from the State Department line that the country's 2009 presidential elections were deeply flawed. In this week's talks, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany -- the so-called P5+1 -- pushed Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium to 20%, a level at which the fuel has undergone most of the processing necessary to be used in forming the core of a nuclear weapon.

Full text:   International negotiators scaled back several key demands on Iran in a bid to advance negotiations aimed at curbing the country's nuclear ambitions, as two days of talks finished with an agreement to meet again in coming weeks.
Iran's top nuclear negotiator called the meetings positive. But Western officials cautioned that the latest two days of negotiations, held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, didn't constitute major progress: Iran has yet to signal clearly it will curtail its nuclear activities in response to the offer, which included a proposal to ease some sanctions, said European Union foreign-policy chief Catherine Ashton.
"I believe in looking at what the results are," she said after talks ended. "We'll have to see what happens next."
The six nations that have been holding talks with Iran stepped back from a demand that the country export its entire stockpile of uranium that has been enriched to 20%, a level close to weapons-grade. Instead, these countries offered to let Iran keep enough in the country to fuel a research reactor, a senior U.S. official said.
They also said that instead of shutting down enrichment at the Fordo nuclear facility near the city of Qom, as previously demanded, that enrichment must stop there. The six powers sought stepped-up monitoring of such enrichment efforts, the official said.
The negotiators offered some easing of the tight web of sanctions that have cut Iran off from the global financial system and driven down its currency, the rial, over the past year, officials said. If Tehran takes the proposed steps, it would win some lifting of nonoil-related and non-financial sanctions, the senior U.S. official said. In addition, the six powers could pledge not to push for fresh sanctions at the United Nations Security Council.
Sanctions to be lifted would include restrictions on trade in gold and precious metals and on Iran's petrochemical sector, two other diplomats said.
In Paris, meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stressed Washington's willingness to meet with Iran's top leaders as a means to advance negotiations on the nuclear program. His comments were among the most direct to date by the Obama administration reflecting its desire to set up a direct diplomatic channel to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
"The president has said publicly on any number of occasions, and it's a matter of public record that he personally communicated to the supreme leader, that he was prepared to engage and to discuss these issues," Mr. Kerry said, appearing alongside his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius.
Mr. Kerry also appeared to confer legitimacy on Iran's government, a departure from the State Department line that the country's 2009 presidential elections were deeply flawed. "Iran is a country with a government that was elected and that sits in the United Nations," Mr. Kerry said. "And it is important for us to deal with nation-states in a way that acts in the best interests of all of us in the world."
This week's talks, the first since June 2012, appeared to meet the fairly low objectives set by European and U.S. officials -- that they lead to additional talks. The sides agreed to hold expert-level talks in Istanbul on March 18 and top-level discussions in Almaty on April 5 and 6.
But in a process that has dragged on for almost a decade -- with three rounds of discussions last year making little progress -- Iran has often agreed to negotiators' proposals only to press back later in an apparent effort to buy time or seek relief from sanctions.
"It reminds me a bit of one year ago in Istanbul," said a diplomat involved in the talks. "We thought something was happening and maybe we could build on it. Frankly I'm not very pessimistic or optimistic. . . . We still need a first concrete result."
In this week's talks, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany -- the so-called P5+1 -- pushed Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium to 20%, a level at which the fuel has undergone most of the processing necessary to be used in forming the core of a nuclear weapon. The P5+1 also urged Iran to take other steps to prove its nuclear activities are, as Tehran says, for peaceful purposes.
The nations said Iran must also take steps to ensure enrichment at Fordo can't be quickly resumed. Inspections across Iran must be tightened to ensure authorities comply, officials said.
The permanent security council members are the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia.
Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, said the P5+1 proposal was "more realistic comparing to what they said in the past," he said. Both sides need to show "a positive and constructive approach and taking reciprocal steps," he said.
---
Re-Engaging Tehran
Main elements of the P5+1's new package, according to diplomats
-- Iran must suspend enrichment of uranium at 20% purity, considered near weapons grade.
-- Offer would 'significantly restrict' stockpile of 20% enriched uranium held in Iran, a departure from the stance that it be exported for reprocessing. Iran would be allowed to produce enough fuel to run a research reactor that produces medical isotopes for cancer patients.
-- Iran must suspend enrichment at underground Fordo site, near Qom, and prevent enrichment from being quickly resumed. The previous plan had called for the Fordo site to be shut down.
-- Monitoring of Iran's nuclear activities would be stepped up to ensure it sticks to the accord.

Abstract: Some analysts also see it as part of a larger drive by Mr. Abe to invigorate the economy through deregulation as he is banking that strong public backing for his economic policies will let him tackle overhauls long debated but never instituted due to the political risks. Since his party was elected on Dec. 16, Mr. Abe's drastic steps to revive Japan's economy, such as strong-arming the Bank of Japan to move vigorously against deflation, have helped boost his popularity to above 70% in the latest polls.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to soon announce a decision to join U.S.-led free-trade talks, a move favored by industry but fiercely opposed by the nation's agriculture lobby.
The move would signal that Mr. Abe is using his popularity for a bold step that other administrations have avoided. It comes as the farm lobby's influence has weakened amid a shrinking and aging rural population and just after Mr. Abe secured a crucial pledge from President Barack Obama in talks last week that rice farmers, the strongest faction of the farm bloc, could be exempted.
Abe administration officials say they are looking to move as quickly as possible on launching talks for entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP, with a potential announcement as early as next week.
The move comes two weeks after the U.S. and European Union said they are launching negotiations to pursue a far-reaching trade pact and is seen as much a political decision as an economic one. Proponents say it would help cement ties with the U.S. as Japan grows increasingly worried about tensions with China, currently its largest export market.
Some analysts also see it as part of a larger drive by Mr. Abe to invigorate the economy through deregulation as he is banking that strong public backing for his economic policies will let him tackle overhauls long debated but never instituted due to the political risks.
Since his party was elected on Dec. 16, Mr. Abe's drastic steps to revive Japan's economy, such as strong-arming the Bank of Japan to move vigorously against deflation, have helped boost his popularity to above 70% in the latest polls.
Nevertheless, the expectation had been that he wouldn't want to risk alienating rural voters, a key constituency for the party, ahead of a crucial upper-house election in July. Mr. Abe desperately wants to win back control of the upper house to help clear the way for his ambitious legislative agenda. His party enjoys a clear majority in the lower house after December elections swept it back into power.
The idea is strongly backed by Japan's big corporations.
"Economic partnership is a pillar of Japan's growth strategy and crucial for a trading nation like Japan," says Yasuchika Hasegawa, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives.
For food importers the potential benefits are clear. Japan currently has 38.5% tariffs on imported beef, 328% for sugar and 778% for rice. "Beef is an expensive item. It would be of great help if the TPP were to reduce our purchase costs," said a spokeswoman for Negishi Food Service, a restaurant operator.
The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, which represents most farmers nationwide, says that it remains against TPP, saying a "hasty decision would undermine Japan's national interests."
But the farm lobby is facing its own issues. Like Japan overall, its members are aging and now constitute just 2% of the population with an average age for farmers of 66, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
Under the basic terms of the TPP, all nations were meant to agree to abolish all import tariffs in the name of free trade.
With the assurance from Mr. Obama last week that some sectors could be exempted, Mr. Abe was quickly given a free hand by the LDP leadership on whether to enter formal negotiations. That sets the stage for a formal announcement from the prime minister, which would start the clock on the required 90-day notice period to the U.S. Congress before negotiations could begin.
Officials said Japan's participation could coincide with the release of a new growth strategy in June, in which Mr. Abe is expected to map out initiatives for deregulation.
"It's possible that Mr. Abe wants to use the TPP, and foreign pressure, to spur deregulation," one trade official said.

Not All Sneakers Are Imported...Yet --- New Balance Fights for Tariffs to Keep Higher-Cost U.S. Factories Humming; $115 for a Custom Pair

Abstract: What's unusual in New Balance's case is that the same tariffs that benefit its U.S. plants boost the cost of the much larger share of the company's shoes that are made outside the U.S. Shoe tariffs have been around since the 1930s, when the U.S. still had a large domestic shoe industry that it wanted to protect from foreign competition. Hal Sirkin, the BCG consultant behind the study, says too much labor is required to justify making all but the most-customized or expensive shoes in the U.S. "It's unlikely you'll see mass amounts of shoes made in the U.S. again," he says, adding that even two years from now it will be 17% to 20% cheaper to make shoes in China than in the U.S. Opponents of the tariffs say that the proposed trade deal would affect only a small share of U.S. shoe imports.

Full text:   Time may be running out for the last American-made running shoes.
New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc., owned by former marathoner Jim Davis and his wife Ann, is the sole athletic-shoe maker that still has factories in the U.S. Those plants churn out about a quarter of the shoes it sells domestically. The rest are imported.
The company has continued to make shoes in the U.S., even though that means settling for less profit. New Balance says the flexibility of its U.S. factories and turnaround times counted in days, rather than weeks, help make up for the higher cost. But a push by rivals to do away with tariffs on imported running shoes, as part of a larger trade deal, could finally tip the scales against its American strategy.
"A rapid reduction of the existing [tariff] agreements would put our factories here at significant risk," says Robert DeMartini, CEO of the Boston-based company, which is fighting to keep the tariffs in place.
There's a long tradition of American companies, including auto makers, fighting for trade barriers to fend off foreign competition. What's unusual in New Balance's case is that the same tariffs that benefit its U.S. plants boost the cost of the much larger share of the company's shoes that are made outside the U.S.
Shoe tariffs have been around since the 1930s, when the U.S. still had a large domestic shoe industry that it wanted to protect from foreign competition. But today, the U.S. imports 99% of its shoes, mostly from Asia.
New Balance, with sales last year of $2.4 billion, views tariffs as one of several factors that keep its U.S. operations viable. The company has invested in new machines and cut out waste at its U.S. plants, which together employ 1,350 people. It also helps that the company's American-made shoes tend to be pricey, retailing for as much as $275.
But even in its most streamlined form, shoe making remains relatively labor-intensive. The upshot, New Balance says, is that it still costs 25% to 35% more to produce shoes in the U.S. than it does in Asia.
Shoe tariffs, which vary widely depending on things like the materials involved, add about $3 to $5 to the cost of a pair of midprice imported running shoes. While that might not seem much, New Balance says the loss of that buffer would make the economics of its American-made strategy that much harder.
The fight over tariffs comes as American manufacturing appears on the cusp of a revival, driven by forces expected to favor companies like New Balance. Wages in China have risen nearly 20% a year since 2007 -- prompting many producers to shift labor-intensive work to lower-cost countries, such as Vietnam. But costs are rising in other parts of Asia, as well.
A recent study by the Boston Consulting Group predicts that by 2015 there will be only about a 10% cost difference between China and the U.S. in making products such as machinery, furniture and plastics. But shoes aren't among them.
Hal Sirkin, the BCG consultant behind the study, says too much labor is required to justify making all but the most-customized or expensive shoes in the U.S. "It's unlikely you'll see mass amounts of shoes made in the U.S. again," he says, adding that even two years from now it will be 17% to 20% cheaper to make shoes in China than in the U.S.
Opponents of the tariffs say that the proposed trade deal would affect only a small share of U.S. shoe imports. That's mostly because China isn't one of the 10 other Pacific Rim nations, along with the U.S., that would be included in the deal. But the move would benefit Vietnam, which supplies just over 8% of America's imported shoes.
Among those fighting the tariffs is New Balance rival Nike Inc., based in Beaverton, Ore. "Lower duties would let us reinvest savings in innovation and in maintaining our global competitiveness, resulting in high-paying jobs in the U.S.," says Greg Rossiter, a company spokesman. It would also help offset rising foreign labor and material costs.
Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group, says cutting tariffs would set the stage for lower consumer prices. "There's also a fairness issue," he says. "We're taxing Americans to protect jobs that are no longer here."
Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, says the Obama administration is seeking an outcome that serves "the broadest possible range of American businesses and workers." The next round of the trade talks take place next month in Singapore.
New Balance says its U.S. factories give it some advantages that help justify their higher costs. For instance, the company has developed a growing business in U.S.-made custom shoes. By going to the company's website, customers can order shoes in any combination of 26 colors of leather and five colors of fabric for nine parts of a shoe. They also can order embroidered slogans. The custom shoes cost $115 a pair and can be delivered in four or five business days, which the company says would be impossible to do from Asia.
Mr. DeMartini, the CEO, says New Balance's U.S. plants -- all of them in New England -- also are "twice as productive" as any of the company's Asian shoe suppliers. "We learned a lot because we had to in order to survive."
The cachet of its pricey U.S.-made shoes at least partly accounts for New Balance's surprising success in exporting from the U.S. Last year, it sold almost 10% of its U.S. production -- about 700,000 pairs of shoes -- abroad, up 29% from two years earlier. One of its fastest-growing markets is China, where the company has 673 retail stores and plans to open 500 this year.
To be sure, few companies are as committed to U.S. manufacturing as New Balance, which traces its origins to 1906, when it started out as a maker of arch supports. Its factory in Skowhegan, Maine, is typical. Spread out over five floors, workers operate machines that cut and stitch fabric and leather.
In one section, big automated stitching machines are embroidering the words "Made in USA" on shoe tongues. Many of the plant's 335 workers are refugees from other shoe companies that have closed in the region.
Ricky Eaton, 66 years old, has worked at the plant for two decades. "It's been leather all my life," he says. "I'm a firm believer in working for a one-man owner," he says. "Otherwise we wouldn't be here now."
Like many of the plant's other workers, Mr. Eaton is convinced that what is saving jobs like his is New Balance's status as a privately owned company, less susceptible to some of the pressures of global business. "Once the corporations get it," he says, "it's all about numbers."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Japan's new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told President Barack Obama he will boost his country's defense capabilities in response to rising tensions in East Asia, a move that could ease pressure on the U.S. at a time of a shrinking defense budget.
In their first meeting since Mr. Abe's party returned to power in December, the two agreed to act resolutely against North Korea as it continues to develop its nuclear-weapons program. Mr. Abe called for additional sanctions against Pyongyang, as he pledged closer cooperation with the U.S. and South Korea, a neighbor with which Japan has had frosty relations despite their close economic ties.
Mr. Abe said he and Mr. Obama agreed that the security alliance between Japan and the U.S. is improving after occasional bumps in the prior three years when his long-ruling conservative party was in Japan's opposition. "The U.S.-Japan alliance is the central foundation for our regional security and so much of what we do in the Pacific region," Mr. Obama said after a bilateral meeting with Mr. Abe at the White House.
Mr. Abe said he discussed recent tensions between Japan and China over a group of uninhabited East China Sea islands, an issue that has concerned U.S. officials. "I told Mr. Obama that Japan intended to respond always calmly and that's exactly what we have done up until now," Mr. Abe said. "We agreed the existence of the Japan-U.S. alliance does contribute to the stability of the region."
Japan and the U.S. issued a joint statement saying the countries are continuing to discuss Japan's participation in negotiations over a regional free-trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. "The two governments will continue their bilateral consultations with respect to Japan's possible interest in joining," the statement said. "While progress has been made on these consultations, more work needs to be done."
Mr. Abe said he confirmed with Mr. Obama that Japan need not promise in advance to give up tariffs on some agricultural products with "sensitivities" at home.
To help ease the steep costs of energy imports following Japan's nuclear accident in 2011, Mr. Abe told Mr. Obama that he would like the U.S. to allow exports of natural gas to Japan, a Japanese official said. Washington currently limits exports abroad other than to its free-trade-agreement partners.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The White House threatened China and other countries with trade and diplomatic action over corporate espionage as it cataloged more than a dozen cases of cyberattacks and commercial thefts at some of the U.S.'s biggest companies.
Top administration officials painted a pervasive portrait of the far-reaching costs of espionage -- competitive disadvantages, job losses, product impacts -- that American firms as well known as General Motors Co. and DuPont Co. have already had to confront.
"There are only two categories of companies affected by trade-secret theft: those that know they've been compromised and those that don't know it yet," Attorney General Eric Holder said at a White House conference Wednesday. "A hacker in China can acquire source code from a software company in Virginia without leaving his or her desk."
A number of corporations backed the push to intensify pressure on foreign governments to combat the theft of trade secrets. John Powell, general counsel of American Superconductor, alleged at the conference that his firm's intellectual property was stolen by its largest customer, a big China wind-turbine manufacturer, with the help of a former employee.
"It's a real threat and it's a really costly threat," he said.
The new strategy is aimed at producing a change in Beijing, which has repeatedly denied it sponsors such incursions, including this week.
Incidents linked to China in recent years include cyberinfiltrations of Google Inc., computer security firm RSA Security Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., and Nortel Networks Corp.
The new push comes on the heels of fresh allegations of Chinese cyberspying, including at The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other media outlets, and represents an effort by Washington to respond to growing complaints about theft of military and corporate secrets.
The administration's strategy, outlined in a report at the conference, will bring together officials from across the government. New measures raise the prospect of stepped-up U.S. trade restrictions on products and services derived from stolen trade secrets and diplomatic pressure to reinforce the administration's commitment to curbing such thefts.
The White House on Wednesday didn't specify actions it would take against China, but the strategy document is peppered with examples of Chinese theft of corporate secrets from top American firms, and officials said the administration has repeatedly raised the theft issue at senior levels of the Chinese government.
"With respect to China, protection of intellectual property and trade secrets remains a serious and highly troubling issue," said Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Robert Hormats, at the White House event, which marked the beginning of the new strategy.
Of the 19 cases that had resulted in charges and convictions detailed in the strategy document, 16 involve theft aimed to benefit entities in China, such as stolen hybrid technology from GM and military secrets from defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., among others.
The Obama administration is casting trade-secret theft as a major threat to both economic and national security. "The theft of trade secrets impacts national security, undermines our global competitiveness, diminishes U.S. export prospects and puts American jobs at risk," said Victoria Espinel, U.S. intellectual-property enforcement coordinator.
Corporate officials at the conference welcomed the move as a start. Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, an industry group, called the administration's new strategy "a catalyst for action," adding, "we can do a lot more."
Wednesday's move follows an executive order that President Barack Obama signed last week to create voluntary cybersecurity standards for companies running critical infrastructure like the electric grid.
Karan Bhatia, a vice president at General Electric Co. voiced support for the administration's new effort -- so long as such security standards remain voluntary.
The administration had been working on both measures for several months; its announcement coincided with a spike in recent disclosures about cyberinfiltrations of the U.S. news media and critical infrastructure by cyberspies believed to be linked to the Chinese government.
"This is what you have to do to get the Chinese to behave differently," said James Lewis, a former top State Department official who is now a cybersecurity specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "You've got to keep pushing on them; you've got to keep grinding."
But, he cautioned, results will likely take several years.
The U.S. had some success in employing a similar strategy of diplomatic and trade pressure in the 1990s to curb Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related military equipment.
In addition to denying it condones computer hacking, China also has said that it is itself a victim of cyberattacks and that Chinese law forbids such attacks.
Akamai Technologies, which monitors large amounts of web traffic, said in the third quarter of 2012 China was the world's No. 1 source of observed attack traffic, with 33% of such traffic. The U.S. was second, at 13%.
U.S. intelligence agencies issued a rare public report in 2011 that fingered Chinese hackers as the "most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage." Senior intelligence officials said the Chinese government and sympathetic hackers are behind the cyberspying.
A House intelligence committee report last year concluded the Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technology Co.'s presence in the U.S. poses a national-security threat. Huawei called the congressional report "an exercise in China-bashing."
As one component of the new strategy, U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence agencies will work more closely with the private sector to school them in counterspying and provide warnings about emerging corporate- espionage threats.
The spy agencies will provide reports to the private sector on key aspects of the threat, including the identity of foreign governments involved, the industry sectors most targeted, and how the espionage is conducted.
The new U.S. strategy also calls for a more aggressive diplomatic response to the theft of trade secrets, much of which is now done by infiltrating computer networks of target companies but some is also still done by recruiting human spies.
The State Department will ensure that a consistent and "appropriate" message is delivered to foreign governments to communicate the administration's commitment to reducing the theft of intellectual property and the importance it places on more effective legal penalties and enforcement for trade-secret theft.
Wednesday's strategy report said Washington would work with its allies to coordinate on ways to pressure countries like China that the U.S. government says are engaged in rampant theft of intellectual property. That effort will be led by the State and Commerce Departments and the U.S. Trade Representative.
The U.S. also will use trade arrangements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership to seek new provisions on trade-secret protections that include penalties similar to those in U.S. law.
Mr. Lewis said that over time, the government will probably need to raise pressure with such actions as denying visas to Chinese researchers or denying certain Chinese companies access to U.S. banks.
The strategy also directs agencies to evaluate current laws and determine if additional legislation is needed to protect trade secrets.

Many Past Espionage Cases Had Links to China
Since 2009, Justice Department lawyers have pursued at least 19 cases of corporate espionage. Most had connections to China, according to case summaries presented in a new U.S. strategy report on trade secrets Wednesday.
Among high-profile cases:
-- In November 2012, Shanshan Du, a former General Motors engineer, and her husband Yu Qin were convicted in Detroit for conspiring to steal hybrid technology trade secrets, intending to use them in a joint venture with an auto maker in China.
-- In September 2012, Sixing Liu was convicted in federal court in New Jersey for exporting U.S. military technology to China and stealing thousands of electronic files from his employer, L-3 Communications.
-- Also in September 2012, Chunlai Yang, a former software engineer for CME Group Inc., pleaded guilty in Illinois to stealing source code. He admitted downloading files with code that made up part of a trading-platform operating system. U.S. authorities said he was planning a firm that would help trading efficiency in China.
-- In August 2012, Hanjuan Jin, a former Motorola engineer, was sentenced in Illinois to four years in prison for stealing Motorola's proprietary iDEN technology for herself and for a company that works for the Chinese military.
-- In March 2012, former DuPont scientist Tze Chao pleaded guilty in California to conspiracy to commit economic espionage, admitting he provided trade secrets concerning a titanium-dioxide making process to Chinese-controlled companies.
-- In January 2012, Yuan Li, a former Sanofi-Aventis chemist, pleaded guilty in New Jersey to making trade secrets of the drug company available for sale through the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese chemicals concern.
-- In December 2011, Kexue Huang was sentenced to over seven years in prison for economic espionage. He had been charged with transporting trade secrets to China while working as a research scientist at Dow AgroSciences LLC.
-- In August 2011, Elliot Doxer pleaded guilty in Massachusetts to economic espionage for providing trade secrets to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer. Mr. Doxer was a former employee of Akamai Technologies who had emailed an Israeli consulate saying that he was willing to provide information that might help Israel.
-- In December 2010, David Yen Lee, a former chemist for paint maker Valspar Corp., was sentenced to 15 months in prison for stealing secrets involving information valued at up to $20 million as he prepared to go to work for a competitor in China. He admitted downloading about 160 secret formulas for paints and coatings, though there was no evidence he actually disclosed any of the stolen trade secrets to his new employer.
-- In November 2010, Yu Xiang Dong, an engineer with Ford Motor Co., pleaded guilty in Michigan to stealing trade secrets. Mr. Yu copied some 4,000 Ford documents onto an external hard drive, including sensitive Ford design documents, and took them to his new prospective employer in China. He was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's merchandise trade balance reached a record monthly deficit of 1.629 trillion yen ($17.5 billion) in January, extending the run of red ink to a record seven months, the Ministry of Finance said Wednesday. Exports, however, showed an improvement as the weak yen helped trade with the U.S.
The result was the worst on record, dating to when comparable figures were first available in January 1979, and was worse than the previous record deficit of 1.481 trillion yen in January of 2012.
The overall balance was "a lot worse" than expected, according to NLI Research Institute economist Taro Saito, who said exports to Europe and the U.S. were weaker than expected.
On the brighter side, exports jumped 6.4% from the same period last year to 4.799 trillion yen, the first increase in eight months.
Exports to China rose 3% from January last year, though economists said it was difficult to make a straightforward comparison, since the Lunar New Year holiday -- during which China takes an extended holiday -- shifted to February this year from January in 2012.
Japan's exports to China are expected to bounce back as tempers cool after a year that brought anti-Tokyo protests in Beijing and riots in Shenzhen, the Japan External Trade Organization said Tuesday.
Despite continued political tensions between the world's second- and third-largest economies, China is forecast to remain Japan's top trading partner for the seventh year in a row.
In 2012, Japanese exports to China fell for the first time since 2009, by 10.4% to $144.7 billion, the trade organization said. Imports, meanwhile, rose 3% to $188.9 billion, the slowest growth pace since 2009.
Overall exports were lifted by a sharp decline in the value of the yen, which has fallen more than 8% this year against the dollar.
At the same time, the weaker yen increased the size of Japan's energy import bill, pushing the value of imports up 7.3% overall to 6.428 trillion yen.

Full text:   MEXICO CITY -- For decades, Mexico's energy policy has largely boiled down to exporting oil for cash to fund state spending. Now the new government is negotiating with rival political parties to curb that practice and instead use state monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos to a different end: cheaper energy, said Pemex CEO Emilio Lozoya.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the 38-year-old chief said the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto was striving to overhaul tax and energy laws this year that Mr. Lozoya said would result in cheaper energy for consumers and companies that could drive a more competitive economy.
Now, the Mexican government relies on Pemex, one of the world's biggest oil firms, for 35% of government spending, leaving the company with little left over to invest in areas like natural gas. Private companies, meanwhile, are largely barred from investing thanks to Mexico's nationalistic energy laws.
The result is an energy-rich country where companies often pay higher prices for energy than elsewhere. Mexico has large reserves of natural gas, for instance. But since Pemex doesn't invest enough in gas, the country imports gas from the U.S. -- raising costs to Mexican firms as they try to compete with global players like China.
"Energy ought to be looked at on a competitive basis and not as a foreign-exchange generator," Mr. Lozoya said, pointing to a prospective investment boost in industries ranging from gas to petrochemicals to fertilizers.
Complicating matters, Mexico's oil output has slipped to 2.55 million barrels a day from a peak of 3.4 million in 2004, as easy oil in the Gulf is replaced by more difficult reserves of deep-water oil and heavy oil onshore. To boost production, the company will need more money, technology and know-how.
Changing Mexico's energy laws is widely seen as an important test for a country that captured the imagination of investors for linking its economy in a free-trade deal with the U.S. in the mid-1990s, but which saw its star dim to other emerging markets like China and Brazil in recent years.
For Mexico, beset by drug violence the past few years, such a move would send a powerful signal to investors, likely driving billions in foreign investment, economists say.
"This is all about regaining the reform momentum, and you don't see that that often in emerging markets today. Taking on those taboos, and those changes, it would re-establish the Mexican narrative as a reformer," said Gray Newman, chief economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley.
Change won't be easy. The oil nationalization in 1938, by Mr. Pena Nieto's own Institutional Revolutionary Party, is seen as a key event in Mexican identity. Some leftist lawmakers, Mexican contractors and even some foreign oil-service firms that work with Pemex on a fee basis might see change as a threat, analysts say.
The freshly appointed Mr. Lozoya, who is seen as close to the president, was careful not to discuss specifics about proposed changes to energy laws in the Tuesday interview, saying it was up to Mexico's political parties. But he did point out that political parties here from left to right had already come together in recent months on topics like education and labor reform.
"Obviously, our challenge is we need to deliver on the pending reforms and governing responsibly over the next years, but I do see this as a very good opportunity for Mexico to retake a path of higher productivity and higher economic growth," he said.
Mexico's conservative opposition, the National Action Party, largely favors a broader opening of the energy business to private investment, while the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution has proposed a more limited opening for areas like refining.
Mr. Newman believes Mr. Pena Nieto may well deliver a broad-ranging reform. "I don't think the prospects for reform have been this strong in Mexico in over 20 years," Mr. Newman said.
The son of a former energy minister, Mr. Lozoya has had a tough start as head of Mexico's largest company, which had 2011 sales of $111 billion. An explosion at a Pemex office building at the company's Mexico City headquarters last month killed 37 workers. The company said the blast was caused by a buildup of methane in the building's cellar, but doesn't yet know what caused the gas to accumulate.
The investigation, led by the country's attorney general's office, will take a few more weeks, Mr. Lozoya said. "We are in mourning, but we're standing and looking forward, and working on our modernization plans," said the executive, who is the grandson of a revolutionary general and politician.
He pointed to the shale-gas revolution in the U.S., along with deep-water and heavy oil, as examples of how Mexico can benefit from new technologies that boost energy output, lower prices and create jobs.
Mexico may hold the world's fourth-biggest reserves of shale gas, according to the U.S. government. But Pemex has drilled only a few wells and not produced any gas. "Mexico ought to be producing more of its own gas, and eventually exporting it," Mr. Lozoya said.

Full text:   China's demand for cotton is helping give the global market for the commodity a boost.
The country's textile mills are importing more cotton than many investors and analysts had expected. This large appetite for imports from the world's biggest cotton consumer, combined with rising consumption of the fiber globally and a decrease in U.S. plantings, has fueled a rally in cotton prices.
Cotton plantings are forecast to fall to the lowest level since 1983, down 27% from 2012, according to estimates from the National Cotton Council, an industry group.
Prices have risen 17% since Aug. 1, the start of the new marketing year, and are near a seven-month high. On Monday, cotton for March delivery rose 0.25 cent, or 0.3%, to 82.92 cents a pound. For much of past year, China snapped up cotton for its strategic stockpiles, which are forecast to be at a record level at the end of the current marketing year on July 31.
With the country's warehouses brimming with cotton, many investors believed the country's mills would turn to these stockpiles for their needs.
But the mills instead are importing, especially from the U.S., the world's biggest cotton exporter. The reason: Mills can get better-quality cotton abroad for roughly the same price.
"Chinese demand is going to be a big player" in the cotton market, said Jimmy Tintle, a speculative investor and chief executive at consulting firm GreenKey Alternative Asset Services in Longwood, Fla.
Mr. Tintle recently placed bullish bets, which profit from rising prices, on cotton futures. He expects prices could rise as high as 95 cents to $1 a pound by May. Prices last traded in this range in January 2012.
Hedge funds and other money managers are holding 59,998 net bullish positions valued at $2.5 billion, a nearly 29-month high, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Many investors are monitoring the results of China's daily auctions of stockpiled cotton run by the China National Cotton Reserves Corp. Mills have taken only a third of the cotton put up for auction since the beginning of the year.
The average price at China's auctions through Feb. 1 has been $1.3534 a pound. Cotton imports cost mills about the same, taking transport costs, a 40% duty and taxes into account, according to cotton traders and merchants. Imported cotton tends to have longer fibers, which mills covet because it makes the fiber easier to spin and dye.
The lackluster cotton auctions in China have coincided with a boom in U.S. cotton export deals. Since early November, U.S. exporters have struck deals to sell 3.8 million bales, with 35% of that slated to go to China. Analysts at INTL FCStone Inc. said the size of export sales has exceeded forecasts. In 2012, U.S. cotton exports to China climbed 60% from the previous year to 6.9 million bales.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that China's total world-wide imports would reach 14 million bales of cotton in the current marketing year, a 12% increase from its forecast in January. One bale of cotton weighs 480 pounds. But in recent weeks, China has started to offer higher-quality cotton to the mills, a move that could drive down prices.
Jordan Lea, co-owner of cotton seller Eastern Trading Co. of Greenville, S.C., said just the existence of China's stockpiles could exert downward pressure on prices. China has enough cotton in warehouses to satisfy five or six years of demand from its mills, Mr. Lea said.
"We're just a little bit anxious [China's] going to keep their best interests at heart," he said, adding that he has placed bearish bets on cotton.
Still, other factors are giving cotton prices a lift. The global clothing industry is staging a strong recovery from the world-wide recession of the latter part of the last decade, boosting cotton demand.
The International Cotton Advisory Committee, an industry group, forecasts global textile consumption will increase 6.1% in 2013 to an all-time high of 80 million metric tons, with cotton fiber accounting for 32% of the market. "Demand is there, world-wide," said Craig Pace, a senior broker at Chicago brokerage United Futures Trading Co. He has placed bullish bets on cotton in the options market and expects prices to trade between 83 cents and 88 cents a pound over the next six months.

Full text:   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in December as exports rose and imports fell, suggesting slight economic growth late last year instead of the previously estimated contraction.
The U.S. deficit in international trade of goods and services shrank nearly 21% to $38.54 billion from a revised $48.61 billion the month before, the Commerce Department said Friday. The decline was the biggest in nearly four years.
Oil exports hit a record high, while the amount of imported oil dropped to its lowest level since 1997. Thanks to new technology, U.S. production of crude and natural gas has expanded, while consumers are using oil more efficiently. Reduced imports of foreign oil, aside from lowering the nation's energy tab, could boost the U.S. growth rate over time.
Friday's report suggests exports -- a key engine of the U.S. recovery -- are finding their footing after stalling last year amid a slowdown in the global economy. Demand for U.S. goods is growing as China's economy picks up and Europe claws its way out of recession.
Yet economists and corporate executives remain worried about how much exports will help the recovery this year. Earlier this month, the Institute for Supply Management said manufacturers' exports expanded in January at a slower pace than December.
Still, the shrinking December gap means the economy probably expanded in the fourth quarter, rather than contracting at an annualized 0.1% rate, as the government recently reported.
Economists said the December trade figures probably added about 0.7 percentage point to the nation's fourth-quarter growth rate. However, a separate report showing a drop in wholesale inventories -- also released Friday -- likely erased 0.4 or 0.5 percentage point of that gain, leaving the U.S. with a weak, but positive, growth rate late last year. Barclays Capital said the economy grew 0.3% in the fourth quarter.
Lower inventories can be a good sign for the economy. As companies sell products sitting on shelves and in warehouses, they may need to restock to meet demand in the first quarter, sending out new orders to manufacturers.
For all of 2012, the trade gap shrank 3.5% to a deficit of $540.4 billion from $559.9 billion in 2011.
Although the trade deficit with China narrowed 15.5% in December as imports slid nearly 12%, the yearlong deficit grew to a record.
Amid the euro zone's debt crisis, the trade deficit with the currency union contracted by nearly 30% in December as imports from the region fell 10% and exports rose marginally.
Despite an overall decline in imports, domestic purchases of consumer goods hit a record $45.25 billion.

Full text:   CHINA
January Trade Surplus
Narrows; Exports Strong
China's trade surplus narrowed slightly in January, but exports and imports both showed robust growth despite a still-sluggish global economy, official data showed Friday.
Still, economists cautioned that the numbers were likely skewed by the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which was in January last year but falls in February this year.
The trade surplus shrank slightly to $29.2 billion in January from $31.6 billion in December as exports posted their strongest growth since April 2011. Exports climbed 25% after a 14.1% rise in December, while imports jumped 28.8%, well ahead of December's 6%, according to customs data.
According to the customs agency's calculation, taking into account that there were five more working days in January this year, exports were up 12.4% on an adjusted basis, while imports rose 3.4%.

State TV Airs Images
Allegedly From U.S. Drone
Iran's state television broadcast footage reportedly extracted from the advanced Central Intelligence Agency spy drone captured in December 2011, the latest in a flurry of moves from Iranian authorities meant to underline the nation's purported military advances.
The videoshowed an aerial view of an airport and a city, said to be a U.S. drone base and Kandahar, Afghanistan. Images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran were also shown, but it was unclear if that footage was meant to depict the drone's seizure.

CHINA
Government Detains 70 in
Crackdown on Tibet Protests
China's government says it has detained 70 people in ethnic Tibetan areas as it steps up a crackdown on self-immolations aimed at protesting communist rule.
The detentions came as Beijing stepped up efforts to blame the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, for protests in which nearly 100 Tibetan monks, nuns and lay people have set themselves on fire since 2009.
The harsh measures are a sign new Chinese leaders installed in November aren't easing up on Tibet despite the protests and international condemnation.
The protesters are calling for Beijing to allow greater religious freedom and the return from exile of the Dalai Lama, who lives in India.

Full text:   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia -- As new Chief Executive Sam Walsh takes control of Rio Tinto, he inherits a big dig in the Mongolian desert that's about to produce tons of copper and gold -- and a shovelful of headaches.
For starters, Mongolia is refusing to support Rio Tinto's efforts to raise as much as $6 billion in loans tied to its Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert.
The $13 billion Oyu Tolgoi project, nearly two decades in development and located in one of the harshest and remotest places, is a huge untapped source of copper. At full production, Oyu Tolgoi could help Rio shed its reputation among investors of being a one-trick pony that makes most of its profits from iron ore, a material heavily dependent on the ups and downs of the global steel market.
The first stage of the Oyu Tolgoi project -- an open pit mine -- is several months ahead of schedule. Rio recently fired up production of a copper concentrator, a plant that crushes copper-flecked rocks into a black copper dust that is smelted into pure copper.
Rio has lined up Chinese smelters to buy much of what the mine will produce in the next three years and has built a paved road through the Gobi Desert for giant trucks to deliver the copper across the border.
It's preparing the next stage: an ambitious "block cave" mine nearly a mile underground -- to access the richest veins of minerals -- that will cost $7.1 billion, according to people familiar with the project.
Erupting at the surface of the deal, however, are tensions between Rio Tinto and the Mongolian government, which owns 34% of the project and will earn revenue from taxes and royalties.
Mongolian President Tsakhia Elbegdorj had harsh words for Rio in a speech reported in a Ulan Bator newspaper this week, accusing the miner of "irresponsible management" leading to cost overruns. "Oyu Tolgoi should help Mongolia prosper, not leave it with a scar," he said.
Rio flew in executives from London to Ulan Bator this week for negotiations. To pressure Rio on the deal, a government official said Thursday it is withdrawing support for the potential $6 billion in project financing that Rio is negotiating with a consortium of lenders including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank's International Finance Corp. and private-sector banks.
Cameron McRae, head of Rio Tinto's local unit, said the company has "always been fully transparent with all our shareholders regarding our project finances, costs and operations." He added: "We will continue to hold as many frank and open discussions as needed to help clarify issues raised by the government of Mongolia."
The Anglo-Australian company has said it hopes to close project financing this quarter, with production starting in 2016.
"At some point there will be a showdown" with the government, said Hayden Bairstow, an analyst for brokerage CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.
The latest bout of tensions erupted in October 2012, when the newly elected Mongolian government asked Rio to reopen the 2009 investment agreement between the company and the government that was meant to guide the project for the next 50 years. The government wants to maximize its share of the profits from the mine, which when at its peak will make enough copper to build 840,000 Statues of Liberty.
Tom Albanese, Rio Tinto's departed chief executive, told the Mongolian government: No changes to the Oyu Tolgoi agreement.
For Mongolia, the massive project, whose spending makes up a third of the country's $10 billion annual gross domestic product, could be a cash cow for government coffers. But many feel the deal, with a structure that leaves a foreign entity as majority owner, isn't generous enough to the Mongolian people, many of whom feel the country's mining boom has left them behind. A third of the population live in poverty by the government's measure.
"The expectations are that we will not get much from this project," said Dorjdari Namkhaijantsan, manager at Open Society Forum Mongolia, a George Soros-funded think tank in Ulan Bator. He specializes in studying Mongolian government finances and mining deals.
Mr. Dorjdari is critical of the way the agreement is structured, but says it would be too hard for the government to change the terms in a significant way. "It's too big to fail for Mongolia," he said. The government earns money through royalties and taxes and will earn dividend payments after a loan that Rio made to the government in exchange for the 34% stake is paid back.
Mongolia has since said it will seek to negotiate within the confines of the 2009 pact. But authorities complain that Rio has structured the project's capital in a way that enriches Rio at the expense of the government's minority stake, thanks to loans made between Rio and its Mongolian subsidiaries. "It's the right of minority shareholders to sort out issues we don't understand," said a government official.
It's not clear what the government is seeking nor how any changes would affect Rio's profits.
The government's efforts to amend its relationship with Rio, along with a major change passed in April to Mongolia's once-friendly foreign investment law, have cast a pall on Mongolia's business climate. A proposal the government is expected to consider this spring to amend the mining investment law has drawn a strong rebuke from the foreign and domestic business community. The mining-law changes would increase government involvement in mining ventures and limit the profit that mining-exploration companies could enjoy.
"The great risk is that if investors feel that any investments they make here might not be honored in a way they expect and they were led to believe, then that understandably makes potential future investors more cautious and perhaps less willing to invest," said David Wyche, the economic and commercial section chief in the U.S. Embassy in Ulan Bator.
For Rio Tinto, Oyu Tolgoi is a big bet on copper and a way to reduce its reliance on iron ore, which makes up 71% of its operating profit world-wide. The Rio-led project has spent $6.6 billion on the first phase, digging an open-pit mine, the copper concentrator, an international airport, a 40-mile water pipeline and a 100-mile electrical line that plugs into China's grid, all in an place where it is minus 29 degrees Fahrenheit in winter, and 120 degrees Fahrenheit in summer.
Getting Oyu Tolgoi in shape has been a challenge. Rio spent months negotiating an agreement with Chinese power suppliers to string the electrical line across the border to supply the mine's crushing and processing equipment. News of the agreement, finally reached in November, sent shares of Turquoise Hill, Rio's Mongolian subsidiary that trades in Toronto and New York, up 11%.
Copper was first discovered in the area of Oyu Tolgoi by Bronze Age nomads. In the 1980s, Soviet geologists did preliminary mapping of the remote area, populated by herders and wild animals such as the Asiatic wild ass and goitered gazelles.
It wasn't until the mid-1990s that a concerted effort began to find a mother lode. Rio's top competitor, BHP Billiton scanned the area and drilled wells starting in 1996, but abandoned the effort. BHP sold the rights for about $40 million to American Robert Friedland, whose company, Ivanhoe Mines, drilled over 2,000 holes and found an amount of copper that will add about 4% of the world's current output per year when the mine is at peak capacity.
In 2006, Ivanhoe brought in Rio Tinto as a strategic partner to develop the mine. Rio gained majority control of the venture in early 2012.

Full text:   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. -- On 67 acres here along the James River, almost 800,000 tons of coal tower in two-story-high stacks, ready to go overseas. The shipping terminal is so busy that this past Christmas Day, workers volunteered for lucrative overtime to load a bulk carrier.
Coal-terminal operator Dominion Terminal Associates, owned by three big mining firms and one of the biggest coal exporters in the U.S., stands at the center of a surprising boom.
For all the troubles of the U.S. coal industry at home, its business with the rest of the world is brisk. Last year, the U.S. set a record for coal exports, with the final tally estimated to top 120 million tons, double what it exported as recently as 2009.
The boom isn't about feeding the voracious appetites of China and India -- not yet. Instead, American coal mined in the eastern U.S. and shipped overseas goes overwhelmingly to Europe, especially the U.K., the Netherlands and Italy.
British coal consumption for electricity rose about 50% in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 2011, as power producers there found coal cheaper than natural gas.
"The gas plant has simply been pushed off the grid by coal plant [in Europe], and that's most marked in the U.K.," said Nigel Yaxley, the managing director of the Association of U.K. Coal Importers, a trade group.
The rise in American coal exports is yet another side effect of the shale-gas revolution in the U.S., itself a result of advances in drilling techniques.
The glut of cheap natural gas has knocked coal off its dominant perch as a source of fuel for U.S. power plants. Tougher environmental rules are also squeezing coal mining in the U.S., and President Obama's inaugural address hinted at more greenhouse-gas regulation to come.
U.S. coal is finding a ready market in countries where natural gas is three to five times more expensive.
For decades, the U.S. has exported high-quality metallurgical coal used in steel mills. But now the growth is coming from steam coal, the kind that's burned in power plants.
Two years ago, barely one-tenth of the coal exported from the port here, known as Hampton Roads, was steam coal. Through the first nine months of 2012, steam coal accounted for about one-third of the total.
Rick Cole, the president of Dominion Terminal Associates, pointed out evidence of the shift on a recent drizzly morning. He carefully nosed his red Toyota Prius around sludgy puddles toward a ziggurat-shaped, crumbly mountain. "That's good steam coal right there, with all those big lumps in it. I would bet money that coal was mined in East Kentucky," he said.
The coal was waiting to be loaded on ships like the 92,000-ton Crystal Tiger, a Panama-flagged bulk carrier that before sunrise would swallow almost 40,000 tons of coal and head out into the Atlantic. A hand-painted motto dominates the stairway at the terminal headquarters: "Coal for the World."
Environmentalists say exporting coal amounts to sending U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions overseas. Groups such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club have opposed half a dozen coal-export terminals planned for the West Coast to ship coal to China.
For U.S. coal-mining firms Peabody Energy Inc., Arch Coal Inc., and Alpha Natural Resources Inc. -- who together own Dominion Terminal Associates -- increased exports offer a way to partially offset declining domestic demand.
St. Louis-based Arch set a record last year with 13.6 million tons exported, nearly double the seven million tons in 2011. It has interests in new export terminals on the West Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, and it hopes to quadruple coal exports by 2020. Arch said this week that exports this year will remain at "elevated levels." Peabody, based in St. Louis as well, is also expanding coal-export terminals on the Gulf Coast.
In all, the U.S. exported $13.8 billion worth of coal in the first 11 months of 2012, including $3.8 billion of steam coal. Lower average prices for each ton of coal left total revenue down slightly from 2011.
Still, some forecasters are cautious about whether U.S. exports can keep rising. The U.K. importing group's Mr. Yaxley said tougher environmental rules and coal-plant phase-outs in the U.K. may start to erode cheap coal's advantage in 2015.
Europe's sluggish economy is another reason U.S. government energy forecasters and the mining association expect coal exports this year to decline slightly from 2012's record.
Protests against coal shipments to Europe are fewer than those against Asian deliveries because critics see the Europe boom as a short-term blip.
Bruce Nilles, the director of the Sierra Club's anticoal campaign, said that 2012 was a "last gasp" for the coal industry and that economics will increasingly be against sending U.S. coal to Europe. "Appalachian coal is going away. So where will the coal come from?" he said.
For now, though, the gloomy images of a coal-mining industry in decline feel far away in Hampton Roads.
"This cheap natural gas may be the best thing that's ever happened to this nation, when all's said and done, and this is coming from a coal person," said Dominion Terminal's Mr. Cole.

Full text:   Japan accused China's navy of locking weapons-guiding radar onto Japanese naval forces twice in the past three weeks, an escalation of their territorial dispute that has heightened fears of a military conflict between the Asian giants -- one that could entangle the U.S.
While no shots were fired, the radar at issue often precedes an attack. The incidents Japan described followed nearly two months of increasing tussles between the two air forces, including the first-ever reported intrusion by China into airspace claimed by Japan and the scrambling of advanced fighter jets by both sides.
The radar incidents "were cases that could have led to an extremely dangerous situation with just one wrong move," Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said at a news conference in Tokyo Tuesday.
Diplomats and analysts say Chinese and Japanese political leaders are all anxious to avoid even a limited military confrontation, stressing that it isn't in the interest of Asia's two largest economies, linked tightly by trade and investment, to engage in a military battle.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Defense Department, Maj. Cathy Wilkinson, said Tuesday that "we have seen and are concerned by the reports of [the Chinese radar] incident" and that the U.S. has long been encouraging all parties to avoid any step that could raise the risk of a miscalculation.
The U.S., Japan's largest military ally, is bound by six-decade-old security treaty to defend Japan from any attack. Moreover, the Obama administration has made clear it is intent on winding down the wars the U.S. is involved in, not joining new ones. Yet the U.S. also is committed to strengthening its defense ties with Japan as part of a strategic "pivot" toward Asia, which Beijing sees as a thinly veiled plot to contain China's expanding economic and military power.
The continuing tensions put Washington in a bind. While the U.S. doesn't want a war in Asia, it also can't risk weakening Japan and emboldening China without undermining its entire strategy in the Pacific. How the East China Sea island dispute is managed will have an impact on whether China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea grow more pointed. That has left Washington in a position to continue pressing for more talks between China and Japan, subtly reminding Beijing that while it takes no position in territorial disputes, it recognizes Tokyo's administrative control.
China's foreign ministry and defense ministry didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. Japan's foreign minister said Chinese officials responded to Tokyo's protests by saying "that they would first like to confirm the facts."
The increasingly testy military shadowboxing in the East China Sea between the two ancient rivals is complicated by the rise of new leaders in both countries trying to establish their security credibility, and by the shifting geopolitical dynamics of a region where China's military and economic power has already unnerved some other countries.
The military tangles mark a turning point in the emergence of China as a major military power apparently determined to reshape the U.S.-designed security architecture that has dominated Asia since 1945. Both Japan and China are intensifying military buildups, justified in part by the need to be prepared for conflict with the other.
"The region increasingly resembles a 21st-century maritime redux of the Balkans a century ago -- a tinderbox on water," wrote former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in Foreign Policy magazine last month, evoking the run-up to World War I.
Most analysts say a full-blown war is highly unlikely. But one worrisome element is a lack of direct communication channels and a code of conduct between the two nations' militaries. When Japanese military officials want to get in touch with counterparts in the People's Liberation Army, military attaches at the Japanese embassy in Beijing send a fax to the Chinese defense ministry, which can take days to respond.
Japanese and Chinese officials agreed last June to create emergency mechanisms to avoid accidental clashes in the East China Sea. The plan was to set up a hotline between defense leaders, to agree on a common radio frequency for vessels and aircraft to communicate in English when approaching each other, and to meet annually to discuss issues of concern. But no further talks have taken place since then.
All sides are mindful of an incident in 2001 when a Chinese fighter jet crashed after clipping the wing of a U.S. spy plane it was trying to intercept off the southern Chinese island of Hainan. U.S. officials couldn't make contact with the Chinese military or foreign ministry for several hours after the incident, said people familiar with it.
The U.S. has been pressing Japanese officials to try to get the hot-line talks moving again, figuring such agreements are key if low-level clashes are to be headed off before they become larger. "What you don't want is midlevel officers making decisions that force leaders of countries into bad strategic options," said a senior U.S. defense official.
Maj. Wilkinson, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said the U.S. has long counseled against moves "that raise tensions and increase the risk of miscalculations that could undermine peace and stability in the region."
At the State Department, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, "Actions such as this escalate tensions and increase the risk of an incident or a miscalculation."
A diplomatic thaw appeared to be emerging late last month, when a senior lawmaker from Japan's ruling coalition visited Beijing and personally handed a letter from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Xi Jinping, the new Chinese leader, raising expectations the two leaders might be open to summit talks.
At a parliamentary session on Wednesday, Mr. Abe said, "It is extremely regrettable that China took such provocative action unilaterally amid signs of emerging dialogue between Japan and China. He urged Beijing to "prevent the recurrence of such incidents and avoid escalating tensions needlessly."
As Japan's complaints show, there is no easy escape from the dispute over the small collection of uninhabited rocksknown as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in Chinawith both sides finding it difficult to back down or give the other a face-saving out.
"We face continued provocations against our inherent land, waters, skies and sovereignty," Mr. Abe told Japanese troops Saturday as he surveyed a military base on Okinawa, a little under 300 miles from the area of dispute. He pledged to "confront the clear and present danger."
Mr. Abe has long been a prominent voice in Japan for taking a tougher line against China, and he followed his landslide election in December with a pledge to build up Japan's military, particularly in the East China Sea. Polls in Japan show both a rising dislike of China and growing popularity for Mr. Abe. Many Japanese, having watched their economy dwindle over two decades and feeling pressure from the Chinese and Korean economies, long to see a stronger nation again and are angered by China's assertive stance in the territorial dispute.
In China, Mr. Xi is under pressure from a fiercely nationalistic Chinese public that, while increasingly critical of corruption and abuse of power, insists the party protect China's territorial interests. Beijing blames the recent tensions on Tokyo's decision to purchase some of the islands from their private owner in September, and it is demanding that Japan abandon its longstanding position of refusing to acknowledge the territorial dispute.
"The Japanese side should stop the illegal activity of repeatedly sending ships and aircraft into the waters and airspace of the Diaoyu islands. . .and work together with China to find an effective way to appropriately control and resolve this issue through dialogue and consultation," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference earlier Tuesday when asked about Chinese ships operating near the islands.
Mr. Xi, who is the military chief as well as Communist Party leader, also is trying to establish credibility among Chinese commanders, many of whom believe the time has come for China to use its newly acquired firepower to assert itself in the region and beyond. Mr. Xi has taken personal charge of the territorial disputes by heading a "leading group" on maritime issues, say people familiar with the matter.
Uniformed commentators continue to shape Chinese public opinion over territorial matters, with several talking openly in recent weeks about the possibility of a war with Japan and conceivably even the U.S.
There has also been a spate of state media reports highlighting military exercises. The People's Liberation Army Daily last week described a recent military exercise that appeared to simulate a U.S. military intervention in a conflict with China. In the exercise, Chinese air force pilots were locked in combat with an imaginary enemy when they were surprised to hear a voice speaking in English over their radio, according to the newspaper.
However, there have been calls for restraint on the Chinese side in recent days. A Chinese general believed to have close personal relations with Mr. Xi was quoted in state media Monday as urging China not to allow another war with Japan to disrupt China's decadeslong efforts to modernize its economy and reclaim its status as Asia's dominant power.
"The construction of our economy has now entered a key phase, and should not be interrupted by a chance occurrence," Gen. Liu Yuan, political commissar of the PLA's General Logistics Department, was quoted as saying in the Global Times newspaper. He added: "The United States and Japan fear that we will catch up with them, and are trying every possible way to contain China's development, but we absolutely cannot be fooled by them."
In the radar incidents Japan reported Tuesday, Defense Minister Onodera said Chinese frigates aimed fire-control radar at a Japanese naval destroyer on Jan. 30 and at a navy helicopter on Jan. 19. While neither incident involved firing of shots -- the step that can follow use of such radar -- this was "highly unusual behavior" that occurs "only in extreme situations," he said. "We intend to push China very hard to restrain from engaging in such dangerous acts."
Japan's defense ministry said the radar targeting the Japanese destroyer -- Japan's 4,400-ton JS Yudachi -- came from a smaller Chinese ship, a Jiangwei-II class missile frigate. The ministry said another Chinese frigate, from the Jiangkai-I class, targeted the Japanese helicopter.
Japan didn't disclose where in the East China Sea the incidents occurred or how close they were to the disputed islands.
The report of the radar incidents followed a steady stream of increasing pressure from China around the disputed islands. Chinese maritime patrol boats have routinely entered territorial waters around the islands, flashing signs such as "Leave Chinese waters" and "Follow the Chinese law." On Jan. 8, such boats stayed in the territorial waters for 13 hours.
As Chinese maritime patrol and military surveillance planes flew into Japan's "air defense identification zone," Japan scrambled fighter planes against them 91 times in October through December -- the most since Tokyo started disclosing such data in 2005.
Like many countries, Japan has a long-standing policy of intercepting unidentified or potentially hostile aircraft entering its air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, which extends 200 miles from its shores. But China disputes the legality of Japan's ADIZ and the airspace Japan claims around the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Maj. Gen. Zhang Zhaozhong, a Chinese military theorist, said in a recent Chinese press report that Beijing needs to "break" Japan's ADIZ with its own aircraft, including fighters.
"If their fighters come and our fighters don't go out, from a diplomatic and military perspective, there is no reciprocity: It's not good," he said. "But if both sides bring out fighter jets, as to whether that might lead to a clash between them, that is another question."
Japanese officials have hinted that Japanese fighters could fire tracer bullets in front of intruding aircraft, an action they haven't taken since 1987, in response to an intruding Soviet plane. China's military hasn't responded officially to that suggestion. But Maj. Gen. Peng Guangqian of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences was quoted by the China News Service as saying that "firing tracer bullets is a type of provocation. It's firing the first shot."
The watershed moment for Japan came on Dec. 13 when Japan said a small Chinese propeller plane violated the airspace over the disputed islands. The surveillance plane, which belonged to China's State Oceanic Administration, flew so low it escaped Japan's land-based radar on a nearby island. Dec. 13 was the anniversary of the 1937 Nanjing massacre, the symbol of Japanese World War II era atrocities in China.
On Jan. 10, China scrambled its own military jets after Japanese fighter planes chased after a Chinese patrol flying near the disputed islands, Japan said.
Within weeks of the Dec. 13 airspace intrusion, which was the first in decades by China, Japan's Mr. Abe unveiled his country's first military-spending increase in 11 years. Among items in the budget was a new radar to replace dated equipment that had missed the Chinese plane.

Full text:   Yum Brands Confronts Yuck Factor in China
You won't find "45-day chicken" in any cookbook, but it has become a potential recipe for disaster at Yum Brands Inc.
The term for preternaturally fast-growing birds allegedly pumped full of dangerous hormones threatens the fast-food giant's critical business in that country. An expose in local media may have dented same-store sales there by 6% during the final quarter after they grew by 9% through the first nine months of 2012. Yum has said its products are safe but that it will strengthen its supervision of suppliers.
Yum's full-year earnings, out Monday, will shed more light on the financial damage from the episode. The company has stuck to its forecast of at least 13% earnings-per-share growth overall for the 11th consecutive year. According to analysts' consensus, it will squeak by on its preferred earnings measures and will easily do so on reported figures at $3.38 a share. In 2011, it earned $2.74 on that basis.
But the danger that Yum's Chinese customers keep saying "yuck" highlights the country's importance.
China has been an almost uninterrupted success story since Yum opened its first KFC there in 1987. The company now has more than 5,400 KFC, Pizza Hut and other outlets there -- more than double what it had five years ago. And although that makes up only 14% of its total restaurants globally, those in China and other emerging markets are mostly company-owned, while only 11% of those in the U.S. are. Their contribution to the bottom line -- as well as the hit from a food-safety scare -- is therefore proportionally far higher.
Along with that threat has come greater opportunity and a correspondingly higher valuation multiple. Compared with rival McDonald's Corp., which has been slower to expand in emerging markets, Yum trades at a valuation premium. But the burger chain's shares have outperformed Yum's by 23% over the past two months in the wake of the food scare. That is despite its own weak fourth-quarter results.
Although niche operators can expand quickly, it is hard for a large, established fast-food brand to achieve much growth these days in mature markets. Developing countries hold the key. As Yum's shareholders are learning, though, what seems like a sweet opportunity can sour quickly.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China's economic relationship with the rest of the world is becoming more balanced, new data show, as China soaks up less money from the outside world and as its central bank is intervening less in markets to keep down the value of the yuan.
The ratio of China's current-account surplus -- the broadest measure of its trade balance with the outside world -- to gross domestic product fell to 2.6% in 2012 from 2.8% a year earlier and more than 10% in 2007, the country's foreign-exchange regulator said Friday.
At the same time, China swung to a capital- and financial-account deficit, meaning there were net outflows of investment capital.
In previous years, China consistently ran large surpluses on both accounts, representing an influx of foreign funds that put pressure on the yuan to appreciate. To fight this appreciation pressure, the central bank, called the People's Bank of China, bought up the majority of the foreign currency that entered the country, leading to a swelling of the country's foreign-exchange reserves.
International critics pointed to the large "twin surpluses" and the accumulation of reserves by the PBOC as evidence that China was keeping its currency artificially cheap to give its companies a competitive advantage.
The 2012 data indicate China is moving toward a more normal macroeconomic state, typical of many economies around the world, where a surplus in one of the two balance-of-payments accounts is usually offset by a deficit in the other.
"Some people are worried about the capital-account deficit, saying that it shows outflows. But to me it only means one thing: that there is less central-bank intervention," said Barclays economist Huang Yiping.
"By definition, if you don't intervene significantly, a current-account surplus means you will have a capital-account deficit," he added.
China's foreign-exchange regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, had a similar interpretation of the data.
"Under a further reformed exchange-rate system where foreign reserves are stable, if there is a current-account surplus, there must necessarily be a capital- and financial-account deficit," it said in a statement accompanying the data.
In absolute terms, China's current-account surplus actually rose slightly to $213.8 billion in 2012 from $201.7 billion a year earlier, but economists say it is the ratio of the surplus to total GDP that is most meaningful.
Meanwhile, China swung to a $117.3 billion capital- and financial-account deficit, from a $221.1 billion surplus in 2011.
China's buildup of foreign-exchange reserves slowed considerably over the period. The country acquired $98.7 billion of foreign currency in 2012, down from $384.8 billion in 2011.
The data are preliminary and subject to revision, SAFE said.
In its statement Friday, SAFE said it can't rule out the possibility that foreign capital will begin flowing back into the country this year. In addition, if growth recovers in major foreign markets like Europe and the U.S., China's trade surplus could widen again, economists say.

Full text:   STOCKHOLM -- Two years after narrowing his focus to better concentrate on the U.S. market, Skanska AB Chief Executive Johan Karlstrom is hoping to catch a bit of a tailwind from President Barack Obama's second term.
The Swedish construction company, which has steered clear of emerging markets it views risky, is rolling in new American business contracts.
Already in the new year, it has announced $430 million in new U.S. deals and is scouring the Midwest, Texas and the West Coast, where it wants to increase its presence, for potential acquisitions.
Skanska is the seventh-biggest construction firm in the U.S. market in terms of new contracts.
The picture could get even brighter for Mr. Karlstrom. Having spent four years running Skanska's U.S. operations, the CEO expects the Obama administration to foster policies that boost the demand for additional health-care infrastructure, such as hospitals, outpatient centers and research laboratories, and upgrades in energy facilities.
Mr. Karlstrom said in a recent interview that Mr. Obama's re-election sent the company a "strong signal" that health-care overhaul will be implemented, leading to demand for additional hospitals and medical infrastructure.
The administration's drive for cleaner energy and energy independence also will benefit Skanska, he said.
In addition to energy and health care, Skanska is busy putting together subways, stadiums and prefabricated skyscrapers. The expansion of New York City's No. 7 subway line to Manhattan's West Side and the erection of the steel structure for the transit station at the city's new World Trade Center Transportation Hub are among its highest-profile projects.
Other recent megaprojects that bear Skanska's signature include New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, completed in 2010.
Over the past five years, the U.S. has represented some 30% of the company's global revenue, but that share is likely to rise as its expansion push bears fruit.
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, 44% of the company's order backlog of 148.7 billion kronor ($23.31 billion) was from the U.S., indicating the growing importance of the market for Skanska.
For Mr. Karlstrom, the U.S. construction market represents a haven amid choppy economic seas in Europe. And it is a safe bet compared with many of the world's promising but risky emerging markets.
Skanska knows something about getting burned by bad moves.
Just before Christmas, write-downs in Latin America reached 860 million Swedish kronor, including hefty charges related to cost overruns.
That is a large dent in profit for Skanska, which estimates its 2012 construction operating income in the neighborhood of $500 million.
After struggling to make projects in India and China profitable, the company retreated from the Asian nations in 2004.
Three years later, it pulled the plug on its operations in Russia, saying it was impossible to run a profitable operation in the country while avoiding questionable labor practices or corruption.
Other Western construction companies have struggled to establish a footprint in China, where large domestic players tend to outshine newcomers.
But some rivals, including U.K.-based contractor Balfour Beatty PLC, are looking to expand to new emerging markets to capitalize on the need for infrastructure construction.
"Theoretically the growth potential for us could be in India and China, but growing in the U.S., where we have the knowledge and size, carries vastly less risk," Mr. Karlstrom said.
The company will now be more prudent when taking on projects in Latin America, he added.
In late 2010, two years after moving back to Sweden from the U.S. to become Skanska's CEO, Mr. Karlstrom launched a growth plan that focused heavily on expanding U.S. operations even as the American economy was emerging from the recession. The effort has greatly increased reliance on the U.S. market for new business.
"The opportunities there are so huge for us" and Skanska is engaged in a record amount of bidding on American deals, he said.
Skanska is also open to growing in the U.S. through acquisitions. A year ago, it bought Industrial Contractors, an Evansville, Ind., company that builds natural-gas-fired plants, environmental control systems and other power and energy sources, and it is searching for additional acquisition targets.
But it hasn't all been a bed of roses. Skanska recently missed out on some of the largest infrastructure projects to enter the market in recent years, as competitors were chosen to build two bridges across the Ohio River, and a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge across New York's Hudson River.

Full text:   [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Where there is a will, Chinese companies will find a way to an initial public offering. A few persistent Chinese firms have recently come to market in Germany, where Deutsche Boerse has welcomed them.
A miniwave of China-based issuers in Frankfurt last year brought the total number of Chinese companies listed there to 22. In the past two years, Chinese issuers outweighed all other foreign nationalities listing in Frankfurt, according to Dealogic. And while only two Chinese companies went public in the U.S. last year, seven debuted in Frankfurt, raising more money in aggregate than those in New York, Dealogic data show.
The deals included a metals maker, textile companies, a handbag manufacturer and a chemicals producer.
To be sure, the transactions remain small. Such deals have raised less than $500 million in total since late 2010.
But why Frankfurt? Deutsche Boerse has actively courted Chinese companies, citing Frankfurt's lower listing fees, easier qualification requirements and a faster IPO process compared with other major exchanges. The light regulatory touch extends to the free float of shares, too.
The average free float of Chinese companies that went public in Germany last year was only about 21%, and at shirt maker Firstextile, it is less than 10%. That means the pre-IPO owners keep a strong grip on their business.
In contrast, other locations were mostly shut off. Hong Kong's IPO boom between 2009 and 2011 ground to a halt last year after most of the newly listed companies underperformed the market. Partly as a result, the city's securities regulator has tightened the listing process. The U.S. appetite for smaller Chinese companies has waned, too, because of a series of high-profile accounting issues.
Chinese companies also have found their home turf difficult, with weak equity performance and bureaucratic stasis before last year's political transition causing a roadblock for potential deals.
So far, the performance of Frankfurt's Chinese stocks has been weak. Nine out of the 12 Chinese firms that have listed in Frankfurt since 2011 trade below their IPO prices. On average, the 12 firms have lost about a third of their value since going public, and all but one has underperformed the broader German stock-market index.
That will likely deter others from listing in Germany for the next two years, says Ulrich Plumbohm, of Shanghai-based merger adviser Plumbohm Corporate Finance.
The lesson for investors is that when relaxed governance or listings standards become a significant draw for emerging-market companies, controversy usually follows.
In London, governance issues at some emerging-markets resource firms eventually led to tighter listing rules. Several Chinese firms that listed on Nasdaq without an IPO have been delisted after allegations of accounting fraud at some of them, such as China MediaExpress, hurt the entire sector.
The dismal performance of Frankfurt's Chinese stocks not only suggests floating them in Germany wasn't a great idea, it may signal they should never have been listed at all.

Short of citing fears of a 2012 Mayan apocalypse, Caterpillar could hardly have set expectations lower than it did when reporting annual results on Monday.
"Despite economic and political uncertainty in the United States, continued economic turmoil in much of Europe and slower growth in China, Caterpillar Inc. today announced record 2012 sales and revenues," is how the company led off.
The apparent take-away: Lesser companies would have been stuck in the mud, but Cat powered through. Shame is, it went on to say that sales in the fourth quarter showed their first year-to-year decline since 2010, and earnings per share that fell short of analysts' estimates.
Cat shares still rose 2% and trade near the highest levels since last spring. And why not? With much of America's political uncertainty now behind it, Europe on the mend and growth picking up in China, all of the things that Cat and other global companies have said were holding them back look to be fading. But so, too, is the rationale for their excuses.

Foreign Money Pours Into Laos --- Neighboring Countries Jostle for Work in Resources and Hydropower; Western Companies Also Step In

Abstract: In a $9 billion economy, the injection of capital from abroad is an important part of the government's plan to expand budding industries by the end of the decade to shake off the country's status as one of the world's 48 least-developed countries. Citing the country's entry into the World Trade Organization next month "and the beginning of the integration of the country into the global economy, we see opportunities for growth in this market," the U.S.-based company says.

Full text:   VIENTIANE, Laos -- On the face of it, Laos is a no man's land for foreign investors.
This landlocked, Southeast Asian nation of 6.5 million people offers a tiny market. Experts say corruption is widespread. And some foreigners say they have been burned when deals in the country unraveled.
Yet investment is pouring in.
Foreign direct investment rose more than 40% in each of the past two years, largely as neighboring countries jostled for work in the resource and hydropower sectors. Chinese companies increasingly are breaking ground on real-estate projects, and Western companies including Coca-Cola Co. and French lens maker Essilor International SA also are stepping in.
The World Bank predicted that Laos would post a record trade deficit of $1.3 billion for last year. The gap would largely stem from imports related to foreign investments, such as fuel, vehicles and construction materials.
The Laotian economy remains small compared with those of neighboring Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar. And foreign direct investment first topped the billion-dollar mark only last year.
But Laos hopes to attract $8 billion in investment from 2011 to 2015, the vast majority of it from foreign investors, to keep its economy expanding around 8% a year. In a $9 billion economy, the injection of capital from abroad is an important part of the government's plan to expand budding industries by the end of the decade to shake off the country's status as one of the world's 48 least-developed countries.
"Laos might not be as interesting as a Vietnam or Thailand, but it's growing, and it provides steady revenue," says Chris Manley, the Laos manager for RMA Lao, the largest U.S. company operating in Laos. The company, which distributes Fords, Land Rovers, John Deere tractors and heavy trucks and equipment, is building showrooms and expanding others to meet a car boom in the capital of Vientiane and in smaller cities.
Part of the appeal for foreign companies lies in establishing a footprint in the region as Southeast Asian nations prepare to form the Asean Economic Community in 2015. The bloc will bring together nearly 10% of the world's population into a shared economy of more than $2 trillion.
Coca-Cola in late November announced plans to build the U.S. company's first bottling plant in Laos. Citing the country's entry into the World Trade Organization next month "and the beginning of the integration of the country into the global economy, we see opportunities for growth in this market," the U.S.-based company says.
Malayan Banking Bhd. in November opened its first Laotian branch, in Vientiane. And Essilor, which makes eyeglass lenses, will build a plant this year in the southwestern province of Savannakhet, the company's first in the region beyond Thailand.
China CAMC Engineering Co. is working on Vientiane's new convention center, which is expected to be completed by November, and is a year into a $600 million plan to reshape Vientiane's waterfront over the next six years or so. The state-owned company long has played a construction role in Laos, a country with only a handful of buildings higher than five stories.
But whether these investors have moved too quickly remains a question. The U.S. State Department has warned that commercial law remains untested here. And risk-assessment firm Maplecroft said in a report this month that "the weak rule of law and frequent government intervention . . . will continue to expose foreign businesses to arbitrary legal action."
Several investments here have gone bust in recent years.
Macau-based Sanum Investments Ltd. says some of the casino operator's assets have been seized by the Laotian government in disputes between Sanum and its local partner and over roughly $23 million in taxes and fees. Sanum, a unit of Netherlands-based Lao Holdings NV, says the claims against it are baseless and that the government appears intent on expropriating the company's businesses, including one of the country's major casinos. Sanum says it invested more than $85 million in its Laotian operations and is seeking international arbitration.
Francis Chagnaud, a Frenchman who has been in the agricultural-forestry business in Laos for two decades, was told to relocate Agroforex Co.'s factory in Vientiane midway through a long-term contract when the state denied the company's landlord an extension. Mr. Chagnaud, who says the government has done little to address the issue, was forced to move when he found one day that part of his factory's roof had been removed overnight.
The Justice Ministry didn't respond to requests for comment about Sanum and Agroforex.
Mr. Chagnaud says the experience hasn't soured him on Laos, and that his troubles are typical in a developing country. "In Laos, the commercial competition may be less, but the state of law is undeveloped. And you should prepare investors for that," he says.
The government says it is working to improve the business climate and cites a streamlined bureaucracy and the country's recent acceptance into the WTO.
"It used to be that you had to go to multiple ministries to get licenses, and that's changed. We've allowed foreigners into most sectors -- hotels and hospitality and tourism -- and most industry, including mining and hydro," says Santisouk Phounesavath, a deputy director in the Ministry of Trade and Commerce.
"Thailand and China have always been willing to take more risks" in Laos, he says. "But now the laws are in place, so I hope this will attract more Western companies. Australia was the first to come. And companies from the U.S. and Europe, they're slowly coming too."

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is raising around $1 billion from the sale of shares in China's biggest lender, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, in what could be the biggest share sale in Asia, excluding Japan, so far this year.
The Wall Street company is selling the Hong Kong-listed shares in a block trade at 5.77 Hong Kong dollars (74 U.S. cents) each, the people said, without disclosing the number of shares. The price represents a 3% discount to ICBC's HK$5.95 closing price Monday.
A person familiar with the situation said the sale reflects an effort by Goldman to manage its risks by reducing the size of its ICBC investment.
Volatility in ICBC's shares led Goldman to report a full-year net loss in Asia in 2011, its first since 2008. The U.S. bank wrote down the value of its investment in ICBC by US$1 billion in the third quarter of 2011 as shares in the Chinese bank tumbled, but recorded a US$99 million mark-to-market gain as the stock rallied in the third quarter.
The stake has been lucrative for the Wall Street bank. Following the current block trade, Goldman will have raised more than US$7.5 billion by selling shares in ICBC. The U.S. company still holds a small stake, the people said. Goldman first bought a 4.9% stake in ICBC for US$2.58 billion in April 2006, before the Chinese bank's Hong Kong listing.
The sale also will help boost Goldman's capital ratio ahead of tougher capital requirements. The Basel III capital rules, currently being implemented in stages world-wide, make it more expensive to hold minority stakes in financial institutions.
From HSBC Holdings PLC to Bank of America Corp., some of the biggest names in global finance have been busy unwinding their investments in financial institutions, partly in response to tougher rules on capital, and partly because of a view that the deals didn't deliver what they promised: an entry into a lucrative and promising market.
Last decade, at the time of their investments in China, many bankers hoped that the nation's financial markets would open up to foreigners quickly and that they could reach increasingly wealthy Chinese over their partners' networks. However, foreign banks still are severely restricted in what they can do in China and their ownership of Chinese financial institutions remains capped.
In some cases, analysts came to see the partnerships as one-sided, with the Chinese banks absorbing technical know-how from their U.S. and European counterparts with no clear benefits, beyond financial gains, in return.
Global companies sold about US$44 billion worth of shares in Asian financial institutions in 2012 to institutional investors or other strategic buyers, up from US$32.7 billion in 2011, according to Dealogic, a data provider.
The new move will be the fifth share sale in ICBC by Goldman since 2009. In April, Goldman sold US$2.3 billion worth of ICBC's Hong Kong-listed shares, or H shares, to Singapore state investment company Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., leaving it with less than 5% of the H shares, and 1.24% of the total share base.

Full text:   DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A fire at a garment factory in the capital of Bangladesh killed seven workers, barely two months after a factory blaze left 112 workers dead and prompted widespread calls to improve safety in the sector.
Workers who survived the fire at the Smart Export garment factory in a Dhaka suburb on Saturday complained that the factory's emergency exit was locked when the fire broke out at around 3 p.m.. After the fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory in November, workers there also had complained of locked fire exits.
Rozina Begum, a 20-year-old sewing-machine operator, said the last thing she remembered before blacking out was being trampled.
"We all ran for the stairs, but the exit was locked," Ms. Begum said. "By the time the guards unlocked it, smoke had filled the room. There was a mad rush. I tripped and fell. People were stepping on my body. Then I lost consciousness. Someone must have pulled me out."
Sharif Ahmed, the owner of Smart didn't answer calls to his cellphone Sunday. Police officials said they hadn't been able to reach senior management of the factory.
Seven bodies were recovered from the burned-out factory, fire officials said. All of the dead were women. Six workers were being treated at the hospital, according to doctors, who said more than 50 received first aid, many after being trampled.
A senior fire official said the Smart Export factory, which occupied the second floor of a two-story building, appeared to have been operating without the requisite licenses and safety equipment.
The fire is another blow to the reputation of Bangladesh, the world's second-largest apparel exporter after China. Concerned that not enough has been done to address workers' concerns, the U.S. Trade Representative's office has said it would decide by spring whether to withdraw, suspend or limit Bangladesh's duty-free benefits under a World Trade Organization arrangement that allows for special treatment of the world's poorest countries.
One of the persistent problems that major retailers and workers-rights advocates complain about is the practice of suppliers' subcontracting to other factories, which can subvert the systems put in place by international retailers to audit factories for safety.
On a tour of the burned-out Smart Export factory Sunday, labels for the brands "Lefties" and "Bershka" were visible on garments on the factory floor. Both are labels owned by Inditex, a Spanish clothing giant.
Rezaul Karim, audit officer for Inditex's Dhaka office, said the company hadn't placed orders at the Smart Export factory. He said as a one-floor outfit renting a converted building with motor garages and a bakery on the ground floor, it was highly unlikely the factory could pass a safety audit by a retailer.
Jesus Echevarria, chief communications officer of Inditex in Spain said it appeared one of the company's Spanish garment providers, which was working with another contractor, subcontracted work to the factory.
He said the provider and contractor deny subcontracting. But since Inditex had indications Lefties and Bershka products were made there, the two companies have been suspended from Inditex's roster of suppliers. Inditex has sent a team from Bangladesh and another from Spain to investigate, he said.
Inditex is one of the world's biggest fashion chains, and Mr. Karim said the Dhaka office audits roughly 150 factories every year.
Following the Tazreen Fashions fire in November, the government promised to take action to improve working conditions in the country's $19 billion garment industry.
Mikail Shiper, a senior official of the Labor Ministry, acknowledged that the government was failing to monitor factories on the bottom rung of the supply chain.
"The Labor Ministry has only 16 inspectors to monitor upward of 5,000 factories," he said. "We're working as fast as possible," he said.

More than Yuan Reason to Like 'Dim Sum' --- Investors are Piling into the Bonds for Their Returns, Not Merely as a Wager that the Chinese Currency Will Appreciate

Abstract: Since November, the money manager has increased its allocation to dim-sum bonds in its Asian ex-Japan bond portfolios. Other investors say there are still plenty of reasons to be cautious around China's offshore bond market. Because it remains a small and nascent market, yuan-denominated bonds trade less frequently than dollar- and euro-denominated debt.

Full text:   Borrowers tapping the market for "dim sum" bonds are starting to win over investors the old-fashioned way -- with higher yields.
For 16 weeks in a row, investors have piled into funds that focus on these bonds, which are denominated in yuan but traded outside mainland China, according to data provider EPFR Global. The $81 million of inflows in the week ended Jan. 16 were the second-highest since EPFR began tracking the data in 2011.
The growing investor appetite is a change from what was happening during much of 2012, when money was being yanked out of the dim-sum bond market.
Since dim-sum bonds began trading in 2009, most investors bought the bonds as a wager that China's currency would appreciate, lifting the value of the bonds. But that strategy backfired last year when China's government took steps to stem the yuan's rise, sending dim-sum bond prices tumbling. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices.
Now, companies are forced to sell bonds at higher yields to compensate for a yuan whose gains are less certain.
"Once the view on the currency changed, then the attitude on the bonds themselves started to change," says Edmund Harriss, a portfolio manager of the $90 million Renminbi Yuan & Bond Fund at Guinness Atkinson Asset Management. Borrowers "haven't got the currency to lean on in quite the same way, so they've got to issue something a bit more attractive" in terms of yield.
The fund has increased its exposure to dim-sum bonds to 65% from 41% at the middle of 2012.
The current average interest paid on newly issued corporate dim-sum bonds is around 4.25%, compared with 3.54% as of December 30, 2011, according to Barclays. That tops the 3.96% payments from U.S. corporate debt with similar maturities. Dim-sum bonds have returned about 2% over the last three months, Barclays said.
As well, companies that recently have tapped the $250 billion market generally have higher credit ratings than borrowers that had dominated in the market's earlier days, adding to the market's allure.
The shift in focus to bond yields, rather than just currency appreciation, is another sign that the dim-sum bond market is maturing just a few years after China began a push to liberalize trading of yuan-denominated instruments globally.
The bulk of issuers are companies based in mainland China and Hong Kong, and foreign companies such as Volkswagen AG that are looking to fund their operations in China.
Companies' dim-sum bonds tend to yield more than comparable debt denominated in major currencies like the euro and dollar. Caterpillar Inc.'s yuan-denominated bond due November 2014 currently yields around 2.37% compared with 0.51% on the company's November 2014 dollar bonds, according to data provider FactSet.
"You can get investment-grade quality . . . and the yield level is somewhere around 3%," says Angus Hui, fund manager of Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management in Hong Kong, where his team oversees $72 billion in assets. "That's quite attractive in today's environment."
Since November, the money manager has increased its allocation to dim-sum bonds in its Asian ex-Japan bond portfolios.
Other investors say there are still plenty of reasons to be cautious around China's offshore bond market. Because it remains a small and nascent market, yuan-denominated bonds trade less frequently than dollar- and euro-denominated debt. That means an investor looking to sell their bondholdings may have trouble finding a buyer at a desirable price.
"We haven't been rushing to accumulate credit denominated in [the offshore yuan]," partly due to the market's small size, says Adam McCabe, senior portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. Aberdeen Asset Management oversees $314 billion in assets globally. Mr. McCabe says he prefers to buy yuan directly to gain exposure to China.
Investors in the past have tread carefully in the dim-sum market because many borrowers weren't rated by major credit-ratings firms. Little information about these borrowers was publicly available.
But that also is changing. In 2012, 57% of dim-sum bonds issued were sold by issuers with credit ratings, compared with 37% in 2011, according to Dealogic. Total issuance held steady last year compared with 2011 at $14 billion. That compares with $5.4 billion in 2010.
The yuan, though no longer the main attraction of the dim-sum bond market, continues to entice many investors eager to diversify away from the dollar and euro. China keeps it within a narrow trading band, reducing the risk of a sudden currency move wiping out bond returns. Strategists at Standard Chartered Bank now expect the yuan to rise about 2% against the dollar in 2013, after it edged up by 1% in 2012.
The yuan hit a record intraday high in mid January. Any further yuan appreciation likely will draw more investors to this market, since it would offer an added bonus to higher yields.
"The market has moved from [a foreign exchange] play to a credit play," says Michael Amorgianos, Standard Chartered Bank's director of the offshore renminbi syndicate desk, whose team arranges dim-sum bond deals.

Full text:   Richard Vedder is incorrect in stating that one of the main reasons for lack of labor-force participation is government benefits ("The Wages of Unemployment," op-ed, Jan. 16). The opposite is true. The existence of growing government benefits, especially food stamps, is evidence of the lack of jobs that pay enough to live on without food stamps.
The lack of jobs, in turn, is due to the unrestricted importation into the U.S. of goods and services from low-wage countries at little or no tariff. The "great sucking sound" of manufacturing jobs going south that Ross Perot talked about during the 1992 presidential campaign has ended with Americans lined up to apply for food stamps and for any job regardless of what it pays.
When Hyundai Motor Group took applications for 877 assembly jobs in 2012, 22,000 people applied for those jobs that paid just $16 per hour. Similarly, Delta Air Lines took applications for 300 flight-attendant jobs in 2012 and received over 20,000 applications. Even McDonald's Corp., not noted for paying high wages, received over a million applications for 60,000 jobs. This is hard evidence that Americans are willing to work, not just live off government handouts as Mr. Vedder claims.
To restore decent wage-paying jobs to the U.S. we must return manufacturing to this country instead of importing everything from China, Mexico and other low-wage countries. I'm not talking just about assembly-line jobs. I'm talking about design, engineering, marketing and other linked jobs that support the entire manufacturing process.

It must be nice to live in such a sheltered world that you can imagine, as Richard Vedder does, that Americans aren't working because they're so lazy they would rather collect food stamps or freeload through college on Pell Grants than get a job. Has Prof. Vedder ever tried feeding himself on $125 a month?
Most food-stamp recipients work or are caring for elderly or disabled family members. The real problem is that, aided by aggressive attacks on workers' right to organize, good-paying jobs have disappeared or been sent overseas, replaced by minimum-wage service-sector jobs that won't support a family.
What we need are policies that empower workers and encourage companies to provide adequate pay and benefits -- and to keep those jobs here, rather than offshoring both jobs and profits. The myth of the lazy poor may be comforting to some, but it doesn't reflect reality.

Mr. Vedder accounts for the full economic costs of subpar growth and high unemployment, pointing out the work-depressing effects at the margin of expanded federal benefit programs. Mr. Vedder's numbers suggest a vicious cycle whereby our weak economy creates fewer jobs, and fewer workers means more government benefits and more benefits lead to less-motivated job hunters, which means fewer employed taxpayers and a weak economy.
However, there is an equally important political side to the high-benefits, high-unemployment side of the ledger. President Obama won re-election with a popular-vote margin of a little more than three million. How many of the new food-stamp recipients (roughly 20 million since 2007), new recipients of Social Security disability payments (two million or so) and Pell Grants (about four million) and the long-term unemployed (about two million more receiving benefits for more than 26 weeks) voted for Republican candidates who wanted smaller government and spending cutbacks?
Democrats who look at the debit and credit sides of the government-dependency ledger get to feel self-righteous about their aid to the needy, and they get to retain political power as long they can avoid blame for lack of jobs and opportunities. On that score, they obscure the debits identified by Mr. Vedder by arguing that food stamps and unemployment benefits are extraordinary boosters of economic growth. That proposition may seem illogical (otherwise we all should receive benefits) and at odds with measly 1.8% growth, but enough voters apparently think they are better off with bigger government and more spending on benefit programs. Long-term economic and psychological costs of dependency are dwarfed by immediate political benefits to Democrats, and the wages of unemployment therefore aren't so troublesome.

Pyongyang Says It Plans
Another Nuclear Test
North Korea warned Thursday that it was prepared to conduct a nuclear test and carry out more long-range rocket launches.
In a statement carried by state media, the National Defense Commission in Pyongyang threatened to wage a "full-fledged confrontation" against the U.S. for what it calls continued hostility.
The declaration follows the U.N. Security Council's condemnation of North Korea on Tuesday and expanded sanctions against the regime for launching a rocket in December.

JAPAN
Trade Deficit Hit Record
$78.3 Billion Last Year
Japan's annual trade gap hit a record 6.927 trillion yen ($78.3 billion) last year, the finance ministry said Thursday, highlighting how a strong yen, a territorial dispute with China and surging energy imports took a toll on an economy driven by manufacturers.
The balance of trade in goods for December, released simultaneously by the ministry, came to 641.5 billion yen in deficit, mainly reflecting weak exports and rising imports. The reading for December was worse than a 548.5 billion yen gap predicted by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and the Nikkei, and up 208% from a year earlier.
While the yen has weakened by about 10% since November -- largely on expectations for aggressive credit easing advocated by new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- economists said it will take about half a year for the impact to take effect.

SYRIA
Turkey Favors No-Fly Zone
But Admits Idea Is Unlikely
Turkey, long an advocate of imposing some kind of no-fly zone on Syria to stop aerial attacks by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad on Syrian cities, is still pushing the idea but seems to recognize that this option appears unlikely.
The idea of a no-fly zone has long foundered because of European and U.S. nervousness that enforcing it could broaden the conflict.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu acknowledged that the military consequences of a no-fly zone could be "problematic."

THAILAND
Editor Sentenced to Prison
For Insulting Monarchy
A court in Thailand sentenced a magazine editor to 10 years in prison for publishing two articles that prosecutors said defamed the country's revered monarchy, focusing fresh international attention on both the way Thailand's strict lese majeste laws are applied and the extent of the country's gaping political divides.
Somyot Prueksakasemsuk was arrested in April 2011 near Thailand's border with Cambodia on charges that the now-defunct "Voice of Thaksin" magazine he edited had broken the law by running a pair of articles criticizing the influence and role of Thailand's constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is regarded as almost divine by some Thais.

Court Orders Release
Of Frenchwoman Cassez
Mexico's Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the release from prison of Frenchwoman Florence Cassez -- who had been sentenced to 60 years in prison eight years ago after being convicted of kidnapping -- because, the court said, her rights were violated in the case.
Justices voted 3-2 in favor of a proposal to throw out the case on grounds that Ms. Cassez's rights were violated during her arrest and the trial, particularly as a result of a staged televised version of her arrest. They ordered her immediate release.

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- Many in the shipping industry see a sluggish year ahead for Chinese exports, a cornerstone of the world's No. 2 economy, despite other indications of growing demand for China's products.
Some executives from shipping companies that carry containers full of Chinese-made products mainly to Europe and North America say they see little evidence of a strong rebound in seaborne exports. Stephen Ng, director of trades for Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd., said the company wasn't seeing "any particular upsurge" in container volumes on its Asia-to-Europe or trans-Pacific services.
OOCL is the container-shipping unit of Hong Kong-listed Orient Overseas International Ltd. The parent said on Tuesday its container-shipping trans-Pacific services volume fell 6.8% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. Volume on Asia-to-Europe services grew 2.8% compared with the year-earlier quarter.
Consulting firm Alphaliner expects modest demand growth this year, forecasting a 1% rise on Asia-Europe services and a 1.6% trans-Pacific rise. Last year, Asia-to-Europe volumes declined 5% while trans-Pacific volumes fell 0.4%, according to Alphaliner estimates. The vast majority of containers on both routes carry exports from China.
"We see a rally in shipping-company shares but the industry has not fundamentally improved," says Bonnie Chan, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, citing a weak trade outlook as well as overcapacity and low rates within the industry.
Chinese exports in December grew a surprising 14% year-on-year compared with modest growth of 2.9% in November. The measure was the latest in a spate of stronger Chinese economic indicators, culminating in Friday's report that China's growth in the fourth quarter accelerated for the first time in more than two years.
But many analysts believe the export numbers overstate the gain, and say the latest figures are influenced by exceptional factors such as backlogs caused by port strikes in the U.S. In a Thursday report, brokerage RBS said it saw data discrepancies related to trade with Hong Kong as well as with what are known as customs special-control areas, which are bonded areas that hold goods destined for export.
Both China's Commerce Ministry and customs officials defend the figures, with a ministry spokesman saying such fluctuations are common in trade data and noting a quarantine fee expired during the period. Zheng Yuesheng, a customs spokesman, said, "Every dollar in our statistical data corresponds to a real declaration bill."
Others said they see some growth. Tim Smith, Maersk Line's North Asia chief executive, said the company was experiencing "a rather unexpected strong pickup in exports" from China, especially to Europe, a rise he said looks set to continue to the Lunar New Year in mid-February.
Still, Mr. Smith said, "this doesn't seem to be a reflection of any underlying improvement in the state of the European economies."

Full text:   With the dream of a big, global trade deal on life support, governments are focusing instead on less-ambitious trade measures that they hope will still give a needed boost to global growth.
In Davos, at the annual meeting of the global elite organized by the World Economic Forum that began Tuesday, trade ministers in recent years have taken stock of progress on the so-called Doha deal. Those talks at the World Trade Organization aim to produce a global accord that would reduce tariffs, eliminate regulations that restrict trade and cut farm subsidies.
But persistent disputes between developed nations, mainly involving the U.S., and developing nations, mainly China and India, have short-circuited the negotiations, leading most observers to conclude there is little chance that momentum for Doha will be revived soon.
"If the leaders of the European Union, the U.S., China and Japan want to revive the WTO, they can," said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "If they don't, it won't happen."
While tariffs around the world have been falling steadily, regulations that limit trade in goods and services have become a rising source of friction between countries. These regulations are among the prime targets of trade negotiations that are moving forward separately.
One is a deal on free trade in environmentally friendly technologies, which would mirror an accord on information-technology products that governments signed in 1996. Another piece of the Doha deal that could move ahead on its own is harmonizing customs procedures and providing money for developing countries to bolster their customs infrastructure. Multinational corporations have thrown their weight behind the agreement.

Full text:   McDonald's 300-Billionth Burger Delayed
For people who appreciate precision, those "Billions and Billions Served" signs atop the golden arches are disturbingly vague. McDonald's Corp. stopped updating the number of burgers sold back in 1994 at 99 billion. But that didn't stop one blogger from estimating the total at 247 billion in March 2010.
Extrapolating from there, the chain was on track to crack 300 billion by this year. A recent slowdown has likely delayed that. Sales slowed throughout 2012 and, in October, McDonald's had its first year-on-year drop in comparable sales since 2003.
That affected Wall Street's assessment of full-year results, due Wednesday. Analysts see McDonald's reporting $1.33 of earnings per share for the fourth quarter, unchanged from a year earlier. As recently as April, the consensus forecast had been $1.46, according to FactSet.
A sales rebound in November as a result of new offerings such as cheddar, bacon and onion burgers and the reintroduction of the McRib in December likely salvaged the full quarter from a revenue decline. But menu tweaks will go only so far in addressing a fundamental problem: Fast food isn't the growth business it once was.
That goes not only for austerity-wracked Europe and the saturated U.S., but emerging markets, too. Even once red-hotYum Brands Inc., which shocked the market with a sales stumble and food-quality scare last year in China, looks vulnerable.
The upshot for McDonald's is that its stock is priced for this slower-growth world -- particularly having trailed peers this past year. Yum, Burger King Worldwide Inc., Domino's Pizza Inc., Wendy's Co. and Sonic Corp. trade at between 18 and 35 times projected 2013 earnings and an average 60% premium to McDonald's, which fetches just 16 times.
The "informal eating out" market is $1 trillion a year globally, according to McDonald's management, with fast food accounting for three-quarters of that. McDonald's already owns around 11% of its market but, with so many competing concepts around, struggles to grab a much bigger piece of that pie.
Growth will depend on new customers who don't yet have the disposable income to enjoy a Big Mac. There are billions and billions of them, but it may take a while before they stop by.

Full text:   LOT POLISH AIRLINES
Poland May Reallocate
All of Carrier's Assets
The Polish government is considering stripping its troubled LOT Polish Airlines of all assets and moving them to a smaller airline that it controls, a person familiar with the matter said Monday, a transition intended to salvage LOT's historic name.
The loss-making LOT in December requested state aid as passenger numbers fell drastically in the second half of 2012. It received $127 million in an emergency loan for six months from the state. The European Commission could rule that this form of public aid distorts competition, which would force LOT to return the funds and likely result in its uncontrolled bankruptcy.
The government, which holds 93% of LOT and 62% of smaller peer Eurolot, said in January that LOT would have to restructure and shrink by nearly a half, with Eurolot taking over domestic and European flights and LOT left to operate routes to the U.S. and Asia. A more radical solution, with Eurolot filling in for LOT on all destinations, could offer a permanent fix. This would allow the LOT brand to continue under the operations of Eurolot without the heavy baggage of debts and staff redundancy negotiations with trade unions.

GLENCORE
Merger With Xstrata
Clears More Hurdles
South Africa's Competition Tribunal said Friday that hearings on the proposed merger between Glencore International PLC and Xstrata PLC have ended after South Africa's state utility Eskom and labor unions withdrew complaints.
The Tribunal now has 10 days to deliver a ruling on the merger deal, Tribunal spokeswoman Nandi Mokoena said. The ruling still could result in conditions being imposed upon the merger, she added.
The announcement removes some of the last few hurdles in the two companies' quest to create the world's fourth-largest diversified miner, with a market capitalization of about $80 billion. Glencore and Xstrata already have secured the backing of their shareholders and the European Union, but are waiting for approval from competition authorities in South Africa and China.
The two companies also said Friday they have agreed to extend the legal deadline for their merger by six weeks to March 15, to provide more time to secure those approvals.

TOTAL SA
Oil Company Keeps Uganda
Exploration License
France's Total SA is set to retain a major oil license in the northern section of Uganda's Lake Albertine Rift basin, thanks to a discovery late last month, company and government officials said.
The discovery -- after months of extensive drilling activity -- is a major boost for Total, whose exploration license for that block, known as 1A, was due to expire in February.
Honey Malinga, the assistant commissioner at Uganda's state-run Petroleum Exploration and Production Department, said the discovery would boost the size of the country's crude reserves, currently estimated at 3.5 billion barrels.
"Total will automatically retain the license," Mr. Malinga said. "We have asked them to apply for an appraisal and production license for the block."
Company spokesman Florent Segura said the discovery requires further appraisal to determine its potential. "Total confirms the discovery of hydrocarbons during the drilling of the exploration well Lyec-1 [in block 1A]," he said in an emailed statement, adding that the company has "asked the authorities to renew the license so that we can continue our exploration program."

SCHLUMBERGER
Oil-Field Company's
4th-Quarter Profit Falls
Schlumberger Ltd.'s fourth-quarter earnings fell 3.7% amid lower revenue from its international operations and a slowdown in North American onshore activity.
However, a strong offshore performance helped soften the blow.
The world's largest oil-field-services company earns more than two-thirds of its revenue internationally, which had insulated it from a downturn in North American activity during the first part of 2012. But the company warned last month that its fourth-quarter earnings would take a hit from weaker-than-expected North America activity and delays in Europe, the former Soviet republics and Africa.
Schlumberger reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.36 billion, or $1.02 a share, down from $1.41 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the same period a year earlier. But excluding items such as merger and integration costs, the company beat analysts' expectations with per-share earnings from continuing operations of $1.08, down from $1.10 a year earlier. Revenue jumped 8.5% to $11.17 billion.

Full text:   Foreign buyers are now being seen as the potential salvation for a Chinese stock market bereft of domestic investors, who have turned their sights to stocks abroad.
China's markets were among the worst performers globally last year, and have performed poorly for the past five years even as other markets have doubled.
Just one-third of Chinese brokerage accounts hold stocks, an all-time low, according to China Securities Depositary and Clearing Corp., which manages clearing and settlement for China's stock markets. Instead, investors are embracing a program that allows them to invest overseas.
Last year marked the biggest increase in quotas for a program known as QDII, for Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors, putting the total since its inauguration in 2007 at $86 billion.
"I don't want to put all my eggs in the same China basket," said Dora Tao, an accountant in Shanghai who is considering investing in the QDII program.
But where Chinese are ignoring their local market, foreign investors see bargains and are maxing out on the quotas that allow them to invest in Chinese stocks that trade in the mainland.
Now China's top securities regulator has said that quotas that allow foreigners to invest in Chinese equity markets could be increased tenfold.
"The five brokers we work with don't have any more quota left for us; everyone is looking to get new quotas," said Aaron Boesky, chief executive of Marco Polo Investments Group. which focuses on mainland Chinese stocks. "Foreign investors who haven't been through those terrible years see China now as a great buying opportunity."
As part of its effort to boost its market, China is expanding those quotas to an eager audience.
That program is known as QFII, for Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors, and allows investment funds, endowments and the like to invest in Chinese stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.
It took China a decade to issue $36 billion in quotas for foreign investors, about a day's worth of combined trading volume for the mainland markets.
Then last April, the country's securities regulator more than doubled QFII quotas to $80 billion, and in December it decided to lift a cap for sovereign-wealth funds and central banks that prevented a single institution from investing more than $1 billion.
With a new program that allows Chinese brokers to get overseas yuan back into the Chinese markets, equities could see up to $70 billion in new foreign money, which equals 5% of the free float of Chinese stocks, Mr. Boesky said.
But foreigners seem to be the only ones who are eager to get into the Chinese market because, unlike the Chinese investors, they haven't experienced the five-year bear market.
Like investors everywhere, Chinese tend to buy the investments with the best recent track record. That is one reason they are putting money overseas.
For the past two years, funds investing overseas have handily beaten the funds that invest inside China. In 2012, funds that let Chinese invest abroad were up an average of 10%, with the top performer up 30%, while the Shanghai stock market was up only slightly.
The Chinese government started the QDII program just as the financial crisis was about to hit, so the inaugural performance was rather inauspicious.
The first four funds fell by as much as 40% and frustrated investors responded by dumping their holdings.
Better subsequent performance and encouragement by the Chinese government -- which is pushing residents to venture abroad to help lower price pressures inside the country on everything from paintings to properties -- have drawn investors back into the funds.
China's central bank said in early January that it would study the possibility of starting a second program, which would allow domestic investors to invest in overseas stocks directly.
Chinese funds that invest abroad often focus on well-known overseas-listed Chinese companies, including Internet darlings such as Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. By doing so, they have managed to avoid damage from the accounting blowups that have plagued some Chinese stocks.
The improving performance of funds that invest abroad has helped bring in more assets. Two-thirds of the 70-some QDII funds were opened in the past two years.
"Chinese investors have gone out of the initial panic stage after the global financial crisis," said Ding Chen, chief executive of CSOP Asset Management. "The sentiment towards overseas investing has turned."
The best performing QDII fund in the past six months is Fortune SG Fund Management's China growth fund, which rose 30% by investing in Hong Kong and U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Luxury goods, emerging markets, properties and commodities also have been popular.
